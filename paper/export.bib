   abstract = {The nearest neighbor decision rule assigns to an unclassified sample point the classification of the nearest of a set of previously classified points. This rule is independent of the underlying joint distribution on the sample points and their classifications, and hence the probability of error R of such a rule must be at least as great as the Bayes probability of error R*-the minimum probability of error over all decision rules taking underlying probability structure into account. However, in a large sample analysis, we will show in the M-category case that R* ≤ R ≤ R*(2 - MR*/(M-1)), where these bounds are the tightest possible, for all suitably smooth underlying distributions. Thus for any number of categories, the probability of error of the nearest neighbor rule is bounded above by twice the Bayes probability of error. In this sense, it may be said that half the classification information in an infinite sample set is contained in the nearest neighbor. © 1967, IEEE. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Aims: The link between spectral diversity and in-situ plant biodiversity is one promising approach to using remote sensing for biodiversity assessment. Nevertheless, there is little evidence as to whether this link is maintained at fine scales, as well as to how it is influenced by vegetation's vertical complexity. Here we test, at the community level in grasslands, the link between diversity of the spectral signal (SDiv) and taxonomic diversity (TDiv), and the influence of vertical complexity. Methods: We used 196 1.5 m × 1.5 m experimental communities with different biodiversity levels. To measure vertical complexity, we quantified height diversity (HDiv) of the most abundant species in the community. TDiv was calculated using the Shannon index based on species cover. Canopy spectral information was gathered using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mounted with a multi-spectral sensor providing spectral information via six 10-nm bands covering the visible and near-infrared region at a spatial resolution of 3 cm. We measured SDiv in a core area of 1 m ×1 m within the communities as mean Euclidean distance of all pixels in a feature space spanned between the two first components of a PCA calculated for the complete raster stack. We modelled SDiv through mixed-effect linear models, using TDiv, HDiv, and their interaction as fixed-effect predictors. Results: Contrary to our expectations, TDiv was negatively linked to SDiv. The diversity in plant height was positively related to SDiv. More importantly, diversity in plant height and TDiv had a significant negative interaction, meaning the more complex the vegetation was in terms of height, the more the SDiv–TDiv relationship became negative. Conclusions: Our results suggest that in order to exploit the SDiv–TDiv link for monitoring purposes, it needs to be contextualized. Moreover, the results highlight that communities’ functional characteristics (i.e. plant height) mediate such a link, calling for new insights into the relation between SDiv and functional diversity.},

   abstract = {Increasing evidence suggests that remotely sensed spectral diversity is linked to plant species richness. However, a conflicting spectral diversity–biodiversity relationship in grasslands has been found in previous studies. In particular, it remains unclear how well the spectral diversity–biodiversity relationship holds in naturally assembled species-rich grasslands. To address the linkage between spectral diversity and plant species richness in a species-rich alpine grassland ecosystem, we investigated (i) the trade-off between spectral and spatial resolution in remote sensing data; (ii) the suitability of three different spectral metrics to describe spectral diversity (coefficient of variation, convex hull volume and spectral species richness) and (iii) the importance of confounding effects of live plant biomass, dead plant biomass and plant life forms on the spectral diversity–biodiversity relationship. We addressed these questions using remote sensing data collected with consumer-grade cameras with four spectral bands and 10 cm spatial resolution on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), airborne imaging spectrometer data (AVIRIS-NG) with 372 bands and 2.5 m spatial resolution, and a fused data product of both datasets. Our findings suggest that a fused dataset can cope with the requirement of both high spatial- and spectral resolution to remotely measure biodiversity. However, in contrast to several previous studies, we found a negative correlation between plant species richness and spectral metrics based on the spectral information content (i.e. spectral complexity). The spectral diversity calculated based on the spectral complexity was sensitive to live and dead plant biomass. Overall, our results suggest that remote sensing of plant species diversity requires a high spatial resolution, the use of classification-based spectral metrics, such as spectral species richness, and awareness of confounding factors (e.g. plant biomass), which may be ecosystem specific.},

The small targets and mixed pixels involved grass species identification in grasslands creates problems, making identification cumbersome and classification accuracy difficult. This study involved the construction of an unmanned aerial vehicle hyperspectral remote sensing system using hyperspectral data of grass species in desert habitats that had been collected under natural light. A multi-resolution combined with a 1 × 1 feature map was formed by multiscale convolution, and grass species data were extracted from hyperspectral fine-grained feature data from grasslands. A recognition and classification model for degradation indicator species CNN was constructed using max pooling to retain the maximum amount of feature detail and up-sampling, reconstructing the feature space and feature fusion to smooth the edge texture of the data and enhance the weak data to alleviate the imbalance among samples. The results showed that the overall identification accuracy of the model for grassland species reached 98.78%, and the kappa coefficient reached 0.92, realizing the high-precision identification of grassland species, which laid the foundation for grassland species detection and research based on unmanned aerial vehicle hyperspectral imagery. In addition, the proposed degradation indicator species CNN model provides a useful reference for the identification and classification of small targets with mixed pixels.},

   abstract = {The species richness and biodiversity of vegetation in Hungary are increasingly threatened by invasive plant species brought in from other continents and foreign ecosystems. These invasive plant species have spread aggressively in the natural and semi-natural habitats of Europe. Common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) is one of the species that pose the greatest ecological menace. Therefore, the primary purpose of the present study is to map and monitor the spread of common milkweed, the most common invasive plant species in Europe. Furthermore, the possibilities to detect and validate this special invasive plant by analyzing hyperspectral remote sensing data were investigated. In combination with field reference data, high-resolution hyperspectral aerial images acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform in 138 spectral bands in areas infected by common milkweed were examined. Then, support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) classification algorithms were applied to the highly accurate field reference data. As a result, common milkweed individuals were distinguished in hyperspectral images, achieving an overall accuracy of 92.95% in the case of supervised SVM classification. Using the ANN model, an overall accuracy of 99.61% was achieved. To evaluate the proposed approach, two experimental tests were conducted, and in both cases, we managed to distinguish the individual specimens within the large variety of spreading invasive species in a study area of 2 ha, based on centimeter spatial resolution hyperspectral UAV imagery.},

   abstract = {Airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data with both rich spectral and spatial features can effectively improve the classification accuracy of vegetation species. However, the spectral data of hundreds of bands brings about problems such as dimensional explosion, which poses a huge challenge for hyperspectral remote sensing classification based on classical parameters models. Deep learning methods have been used for remotely sensed images classification in recent years, but the popular HSI datasets including Kennedy Space Center, Indian Pines, Pavia University scene and Salinas scene, have low spatial resolution, significant differences between categories, and regular boundaries. When applied to the classification of forestry tree species, the accuracy often decreases because the spectral response of different plants of the same family and genus are very similar, especially under the fragmented species distribution, complex topography and the occluded canopy. So we collect new data sets, selected Gaofeng State Owned Forest Farm in Guangxi province in south China as the research area and adopted the airborne hyperspectral data obtained by the LiCHy system of the Chinese Academy of Forestry to explore an improved three-dimensional convolutional neural network(3D-CNN) model for tree species classification. The proposed model uses raw data as input without dimension reduction or feature screening, and simultaneously extracts spectral and spatial features. After the 3D convolutional layer, the captured high-level semantic concept is a joint spatial spectral feature representation, so we can turn it into a one-dimensional feature as a new input to learn a more abstract level of expression. The widely used earlystop method is also used to prevent overfitting. The proposed model is a lightweight, generalized, and fast convergence classification model, by which the short-time and large-area of multiple tree species classification with high-precision can be realized. The result shows that the 3D-1D CNN model can shorten the training time of the 3D CNN model by 60% and achieve a classification accuracy of 93.14% within 50 ha in 6.37 min, which provides a basis for the classification of tree species, the mapping of forest form and the inventory of forest resources.},

   abstract = {During the last two decades, forest monitoring and inventory systems have moved from field surveys to remote sensing-based methods. These methods tend to focus on economically significant components of forests, thus leaving out many factors vital for forest biodiversity, such as the occurrence of species with low economical but high ecological values. Airborne hyperspectral imagery has shown significant potential for tree species classification, but the most common analysis methods, such as random forest and support vector machines, require manual feature engineering in order to utilize both spatial and spectral features, whereas deep learning methods are able to extract these features from the raw data. Our research focused on the classification of the major tree species Scots pine, Norway spruce and birch, together with an ecologically valuable keystone species, European aspen, which has a sparse and scattered occurrence in boreal forests. We compared the performance of three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) with the support vector machine, random forest, gradient boosting machine and artificial neural network in individual tree species classification from hyperspectral data with high spatial and spectral resolution. We collected hyperspectral and LiDAR data along with extensive ground reference data measurements of tree species from the 83 km2 study area located in the southern boreal zone in Finland. A LiDAR-derived canopy height model was used to match ground reference data to aerial imagery. The best performing 3D-CNN, utilizing 4 m image patches, was able to achieve an F1-score of 0.91 for aspen, an overall F1-score of 0.86 and an overall accuracy of 87%, while the lowest performing 3D-CNN utilizing 10 m image patches achieved an F1-score of 0.83 and an accuracy of 85%. In comparison, the support-vector machine achieved an F1-score of 0.82 and an accuracy of 82.4% and the artificial neural network achieved an F1-score of 0.82 and an accuracy of 81.7%. Compared to the reference models, 3D-CNNs were more efficient in distinguishing coniferous species from each other, with a concurrent high accuracy for aspen classification. Deep neural networks, being black box models, hide the information about how they reach their decision. We used both occlusion and saliency maps to interpret our models. Finally, we used the best performing 3D-CNN to produce a wall-to-wall tree species map for the full study area that can later be used as a reference prediction in, for instance, tree species mapping from multispectral satellite images. The improved tree species classification demonstrated by our study can benefit both sustainable forestry and biodiversity conservation.},

@article{Billings1968BR,
   abstract = {Summary ‘How are plants adapted to the low temperatures and other stresses of arctic and alpine environments ?’ At present it is not possible to answer this question completely. Much work remains to be done, particularly on low-temperature metabolism, frost resistance, and the environmental cues and requirements for flowering, dormancy, regrowth, and germination. However, in brief, we can say that plants are adapted to these severe environments by employing combinations of the following general characteristics: 1. Life form: perennial herb, prostrate shrub, or lichen. Perennial herbs have greatest part of biomass underground. 2. Seed dormancy: generally controlled by environment; seeds can remain dormant for long periods of time at low temperatures since they require temperatures well above freezing for germination. 3. Seedling establishment: rare and very slow; it is often several years before a seedling is safely established. 4. Chlorophyll content: in both alpine and arctic ecosystems not greatly different on a land-area basis from that in temperate herbaceous communities. Within a single species there is more chlorophyll in leaves of arctic populations than in those of alpine populations. 5. Photosynthesis and respiration: (a) These are at high rates for only a few weeks when temperatures and light are favourable. (b) Optimum photosynthesis rates are at lower temperatures than for ordinary plants; rates are both genetically and environmentally controlled with phenotypic plasticity very marked. (c) Dark respiration is higher at all temperatures than for ordinary plants; rate is both genetically and environmentally controlled, with phenotypic plasticity very pronounced, i.e. low-temperature environment increases the rate at all temperatures. (d) Alpine plants have higher light-saturation values in photosynthesis than do arctic or lowland plants; light saturation closely tied to temperature. (e) There is some evidence that alpine plants can carry on photosynthesis at lower carbon dioxide concentrations than can other plants. (f) Annual productivity is low, but daily productivity during growing season can be as high as that of most temperate herbaceous vegetation. Productivity can be increased by temperature, nutrients, or water. 6. Drought resistance: most drought stress in winter in exposed sites is due to frozen soils and dry winds. It is met by decreased water potentials, higher concentrations of soluble carbohydrates, and closed stomates. Little drought resistance in snowbank plants. Alpine plants adapted to summer drought stress can carry on photosynthesis at low water potentials; alpine or arctic plants of moist sites cannot do this. 7. Breaking of dormancy: controlled by mean temperatures near or above 0° C., and in some cases by photoperiod also. 8. Growth: very rapid even at low positive temperatures. Respiration greatly exceeds photosynthesis in early re-growth of perennials. Internal photosynthesis may occur in hollow stems of larger plants during early growth. Nitrogen and phosphorus often limiting in cold soil. 9. Food storage: characteristic of all alpine and arctic plants except annuals. Carbohydrates mostly stored underground in herbaceous perennials. Lipids in old leaves and stems of prostrate evergreen shrubs. Depleted in early growth, and usually restored after flowering. 10. Winter survival: survival and frost resistance are excellent after hardening. Cold resistance closely tied to content of soluble carbohydrates, particularly raffinose. 11. Flowering: flower buds are pre-formed the year before. Complete development and anthesis dependent upon temperature of the flowering year and also, in some cases, upon photoperiod. 12. Pollination: mostly insect-pollinated in alpine regions and even in Arctic, but to a lesser extent. Wind-pollination increasingly more important with increasing latitude. Diptera more important than bees in the Arctic and in the highest mountains. 13. Seed production: opportunistic, and dependent upon temperature during flowering period and latter half of growing season. 14. Vegetative reproduction: by rhizomes, bulbils, or layering. More common and important in Arctic than in alpine areas. 15. Onset of dormancy: triggered by photoperiod, low temperatures, and drought. Dormant plant extremely resistant to low temperatures.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we propose a context-sensitive technique for unsupervised change detection in multitemporal remote sensing images. The technique is based on fuzzy clustering approach and takes care of spatial correlation between neighboring pixels of the difference image produced by comparing two images acquired on the same geographical area at different times. Since the ranges of pixel values of the difference image belonging to the two clusters (changed and unchanged) generally have overlap, fuzzy clustering techniques seem to be an appropriate and realistic choice to identify them (as we already know from pattern recognition literatures that fuzzy set can handle this type of situation very well). Two fuzzy clustering algorithms, namely fuzzy c-means (FCM) and Gustafson-Kessel clustering (GKC) algorithms have been used for this task in the proposed work. For clustering purpose various image features are extracted using the neighborhood information of pixels. Hybridization of FCM and GKC with two other optimization techniques, genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated annealing (SA), is made to further enhance the performance. To show the effectiveness of the proposed technique, experiments are conducted on two multispectral and multitemporal remote sensing images. A fuzzy cluster validity index (Xie-Beni) is used to quantitatively evaluate the performance. Results are compared with those of existing Markov random field (MRF) and neural network based algorithms and found to be superior. The proposed technique is less time consuming and unlike MRF does not require any a priori knowledge of distributions of changed and unchanged pixels. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) harbors abundant and diverse plant life owing to its high habitat heterogeneity. However, the distribution pattern of biodiversity hotspots and their conservation status remain unclear. Based on 148,283 high-resolution occurrence coordinates of 13,450 seed plants, we identified hotspots by integrating data from species richness, species complementarity and spatial phylogenetics. Nine hotspot areas were identified that contained 89% of species but covered only 7% of the total land area of the QTP. Four of nine hotspots were identified firstly, including west Nyainqentanglha Mountains, the middle reaches of Lancang and Jinsha Rivers, the upper reaches of Yellow River and Qilian Mountains. Analysis of conservation efficiency indicated national nature reserves (NNRs) covered 55% of the hotspots, whereas NNRs and provincial nature reserves (PNRs) together protected 73% of the hotspots. Conservation efforts, such as establishing new protected areas and upgrading the level of existing nature reserves, should be strengthened in the conservation gaps. Targeted conservation should be carried out for species endemic to QTP due to their narrow distribution range and low conservation effectiveness. Niche modeling for 336 threatened plants indicated there were apparent range shifts of suitable habitat areas from the eastern edge to the center of the plateau under future climate scenarios, and conservation priority should be focused on the southern QTP for where have stable habitats.},

   abstract = {The rapidly increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases may lead to significant changes in regional and seasonal climate patterns. Such changes can strongly influence the diversity and distribution of species and, therefore, affect ecosystems and biodiversity. To assess these changes we developed a model, called EUROMOVE. The model uses climate data from 1990 to 2050 as compiled from the IMAGE 2 model, and determines climate envelopes for about 1400 plant species by multiple logistic regression analysis. The climate envelopes were applied to the projected climate to obtain predictions about plant diversity and distributions by 2050. For each European grid cell, EUROMOVE calculates which species would still occur in forecasted future climate conditions and which not. The results show major changes in biodiversity by 2050. On average, 32% of the European plant species that were present in a cell in 1990 would disappear from that cell. The area, in which 32% or more of the 1990 species will disappear, takes up 44% of the modelled European area. Individual responses of the plant species to the forecasted climate change were diverse. In reviewing possible future trends, we found that plant species, in general, would find their current climate envelopes further northeast by 2050, shifting ranges that were comparable with those ranges in other studies.},

   abstract = {Aim: There has been considerable recent interest in modelling the potential distributions of invasive species. However, research has developed in two opposite directions: the first, focusing on screening, utilizes phenomenological models; the second, focusing on predictions of invasion dynamics, utilizes mechanistic models. Here, we present hybrid modelling as an approach to bridge the gap and to integrate the advantages of both research directions. Location: Global. Methods: First, we briefly summarize the characteristics and limitations of both approaches (screening vs. understanding). Then, we review the recent developments of hybrid models, discuss their current problems and offer suggestions to improve them. Results: Generally, hybrid models are able to combine the advantages of currently used phenomenological and mechanistic approaches. Main challenges in building hybrid models are the choices of the appropriate degree of detail and efficiency and the decision on how to connect the different sub-models. Given these challenges, we discuss the links between the phenomenological and the mechanistic model parameters, the underlying concepts of fundamental and realized niches and the problem of feedback loops between population dynamics and environmental factors. Main conclusions: Once the above challenges have been addressed and the necessary framework has been developed, hybrid models will provide outstanding tools for overcoming past limitations and will provide the means to make reliable and robust predictions of the potential distribution of invasive species, their population dynamics and the potential outcomes of the overall invasion process. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {ABSTRACT Aim? Two core assumptions of species distribution models (SDMs) do not hold when modelling invasive species. Invasives are not in equilibrium with their environment and niche quantification and transferability in space and time are limited. Here, we test whether combining global- and regional-scale data in a novel framework can overcome these limitations. Beyond simply improving regional niche modelling of non-native species, the framework also makes use of the violation of regional equilibrium assumptions, and aims at estimating the stage of invasion, range filling and risk of spread in the near future for 27 invasive species in the French Alps. Innovation? For each invader we built three sets of SDMs using a committee averaging method: one global model and two regional models (a conventional model and one using the global model output to weight pseudo-absences). Model performances were compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, the true skill statistic, sensitivity and specificity scores. Then, we extracted the predictions for observed presences and compared them to global and regional models. This comparison made it possible to identify whether invasive species were observed within or outside of their regional and global niches. Main conclusions? This study provides a novel methodological framework for improving the regional modelling of invasive species, where the use of a global model output to weight pseudo-absences in a regional model significantly improved the predictive performance of regional SDMs. Additionally, the comparison of the global and regional model outputs revealed distinct patterns of niche estimates and range filling among the species. These differences allowed us to draw conclusions about the stage of invasion and the risk of spread in the near future, which both correspond to experts' expectations. This framework can be easily applied to a large number of species and is therefore useful for control of biological invasions and eradication planning.},

   abstract = {Methods for habitat modeling based on landscape simulations and population viability modeling based on habitat quality are well developed, but no published study of which we are aware has effectively joined them in a single, comprehensive analysis. We demonstrate the application of a population viability model for ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus) that is linked to realistic landscape simulations using a GIS-based habitat suitability index (HSI) model. We simulated potential future characteristics of a hardwood forest in southern Missouri under two tree harvest scenarios using LANDIS. We applied three different versions of the HSI model (lower, best, and upper estimates) to output from the landscape simulations and used RAMAS GIS to link estimates of temporally dynamic habitat suitability, through fecundity and carrying capacity, to ovenbird population viability. Abundances and viability differed more between the upper and lower HSI estimates than between the two forest management scenarios. The viability model was as sensitive to the relationship between reproductive success and habitat suitability as it was to rates of first-year survival and reproductive success itself. Habitat-based viability models and the wildlife studies they support, therefore, would benefit greatly from improving the accuracy and precision of habitat suitability estimates.Combining landscape, habitat, and viability models in a single analysis provides benefits beyond those of the individual modeling stages. A comprehensive modeling approach encompasses all components and processes of interest, allows direct comparison of the relative levels of uncertainty in each stage of modeling, and allows analysis of the economic benefits and costs of different land use plans, which may be affected by landscape management, habitat manipulation, and wildlife conservation efforts. Using population viability, habitat suitability, and landscape simulation models in an integrated analysis for conservation planning is an important advancement because habitat quality is a critical link between human land use decisions and wildlife population viability. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = { Abstract. The relationships between the distribution of alpine species and selected environmental variables are investigated by using two types of generalized linear models (GLMs) in a limited study area in the Valais region (Switzerland). The empirical relationships are used in a predictive sense to mimic the potential abundances of alpine species over a regular grid. Here, we present the results for the alpine sedge Carex curvula ssp. curvula . The modelling approach consists of (1) a binomial GLM, including only the mean annual temperature as explanatory variable, which is adjusted to species presence/absence data in the entire study area; (2) a logistic model restricted to stands occurring within the a priori defined temperature range for the species ‐ which allows ordinal abundance data to be adjusted; (3) the two species‐response functions combined in a GIS to generate a map of the species' potential abundance in the study area; (4) model predictions filtered by the classes of the qualitative variables under which the species never occur. Such a stratified approach used to better fit the variability within the optimal altitudinal zone for the species. Removing stand descriptions from altitudes too high or too low, where the species is unlikely to occur, enhances the global modelling performance by allowing the identification of important environmental variables only retained in the second model. The model evaluation is finally carried out with the γ‐measure of association in an ordinal contingency table. It shows that abundance is satisfactorily predicted for C. curvula . },

Using projections of species' distributions for future climate scenarios, we assess extinction risks for sample regions that cover some 20% of the Earth's terrestrial surface. Exploring three approaches in which the estimated probability of extinction shows a power-law relationship with geographical range size, we predict, on the basis of mid-range climate-warming scenarios for 2050, that 15–37% of species in our sample of regions and taxa will be ‘committed to extinction’. When the average of the three methods and two dispersal scenarios is taken, minimal climate-warming scenarios produce lower projections of species committed to extinction (∼18%) than mid-range (∼24%) and maximum-change (∼35%) scenarios. These estimates show the importance of rapid implementation of technologies to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and strategies for carbon sequestration.},

   abstract = {With the rise of new powerful statistical techniques and GIS tools, the development of predictive habitat distribution models has rapidly increased in ecology. Such models are static and probabilistic in nature, since they statistically relate the geographical distribution of species or communities to their present environment. A wide array of models has been developed to cover aspects as diverse as biogeography, conservation biology, climate change research, and habitat or species management. In this paper, we present a review of predictive habitat distribution modeling. The variety of statistical techniques used is growing. Ordinary multiple regression and its generalized form (GLM) are very popular and are often used for modeling species distributions. Other methods include neural networks, ordination and classification methods, Bayesian models, locally weighted approaches (e.g. GAM), environmental envelopes or even combinations of these models. The selection of an appropriate method should not depend solely on statistical considerations. Some models are better suited to reflect theoretical findings on the shape and nature of the species' response (or realized niche). Conceptual considerations include e.g. the trade-off between optimizing accuracy versus optimizing generality. In the field of static distribution modeling, the latter is mostly related to selecting appropriate predictor variables and to designing an appropriate procedure for model selection. New methods, including threshold-independent measures (e.g. receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-plots) and resampling techniques (e.g. bootstrap, cross-validation) have been introduced in ecology for testing the accuracy of predictive models. The choice of an evaluation measure should be driven primarily by the goals of the study. This may possibly lead to the attribution of different weights to the various types of prediction errors (e.g. omission, commission or confusion). Testing the model in a wider range of situations (in space and time) will permit one to define the range of applications for which the model predictions are suitable. In turn, the qualification of the model depends primarily on the goals of the study that define the qualification criteria and on the usability of the model, rather than on statistics alone. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

   abstract = {Abstract High-altitude forests are very important for local livelihood in the vulnerable environment of the densely populated tropical highlands. Humans need the ecosystem services of the forest and directly impact the forest through livestock herding, fire, and wood harvesting. Nevertheless, temperature-sensitive tree lines in the tropics are scarcely investigated in comparison with higher northern latitudes. In this study, the Erica arborea L. tree line is studied in a tropical mountain in the North Ethiopian highlands: Lib Amba of the Abune Yosef Mountain range (12°04?N, 39°22?E, 3993?m asl). The present tree line and forest cover was recorded by high-resolution satellite imagery from Google Maps and field data (2010?2013), while historical forest cover was studied from aerial photographs (1965?1982) and repeat photography (1917?2013). The aerial and satellite images were orthorectified and classified in forest/non-forest binary maps. The binary forest layers were used to detect forest-cover change and tree line dynamics by image differencing between the three time layers (1965?1982?2010). These maps and a terrestrial photograph indicate two periods of deforestation (1917?1965 and 1982?2013), whereas the forest cover was stable between 1965 and 1982. Deforestation was especially severe (with 63%) between 1982 and 2010, associated with a population increase from 77 to 153 inhabitants per square km. There is significant evidence that the elevation of the E. arborea L. tree line increased from 7 to 15 vertical meters between 1965 and 2010, in an area with decreasing anthropozoogenic pressure.

   abstract = {Aims: The 20th century has been marked by dramatic changes in land use, disturbance regimes and climate, which have interacted to affect global ecological patterns and dynamics, including changes in the extent, composition and structure of forest cover. Although much research has highlighted dramatic, short-term ecological change, on-going trends of land-use change and climate change began more than a century ago. Consequently, quantifying and understanding long-term (e.g. centennial) ecological change is critical to contextualizing recent patterns and processes. Here we document changes in the extent, position and composition of sub-alpine forests over the past century in eastern Switzerland. Location: Davos region of the Swiss Alps, eastern Switzerland. Methods: Position of tree line, forest cover and forest composition were evaluated using a unique combination of Object-Based Image Classification of an historical (1909) map, recent (2009) aerial photography and repeat terrestrial photography to minimize the inherent bias of each data source, while providing the most robust representation of long-term ecological change. Results: Over the past century total forest cover expanded by 64.6% and the position of sub-alpine tree line increased on all aspects. Total forest cover also increased at the highest and lowest elevations on all aspects. Dominance of European larch increased at the highest elevations, but decreased at the lowest elevations, where it was replaced by Norway spruce. These patterns suggest land use has been the most important driver of forest change over the past century. Conclusions: Major changes in the extent, structure and dynamics of sub-alpine forests in the Alps initiated earlier than previously documented and most change occurred prior to the middle of the 20th century. Furthermore, these changes were likely driven primarily by changes in land use, rather than by changes in climate. A combination of data sources and methodological approaches, such as those of the current study, provides a clearer view of long-term changes and minimize the biases associated with any single data source or methodology.},

Species identification accuracy exceeds 95% for birds, reptiles, mammals, and amphibians, but seed plants, molluscs, and fishes scored below 90%. Our SDMs for 132 terrestrial plants and animals across Japan revealed that incorporating Biome data into traditional survey data improved accuracy. For endangered species, traditional survey data required >2000 records for accurate models (Boyce index ≥ 0.9), while blending the two data sources reduced this to around 300. The uniform coverage of urban-natural gradients by Biome data, compared to traditional data biased towards natural areas, may explain this improvement. Combining multiple data sources better estimates species distributions, aiding in protected area designation and ecosystem service assessment. Establishing a platform for accumulating community-sourced distribution data will contribute to conserving and monitoring natural ecosystems.},

   abstract = {Background Recently there has been increasing focus on monitoring pollinating insects, due to concerns about their declines, and interest in the role of volunteers in monitoring pollinators, particularly bumblebees, via citizen science.   Methodology / Principal Findings The Big Bumblebee Discovery was a one-year citizen science project run by a partnership of EDF Energy, the British Science Association and the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology which sought to assess the influence of the landscape at multiple scales on the diversity and abundance of bumblebees. Timed counts of bumblebees (Bombus spp.; identified to six colour groups) visiting focal plants of lavender (Lavendula spp.) were carried out by about 13 000 primary school children (7–11 years old) from over 4000 schools across the UK. 3948 reports were received totalling 26 868 bumblebees. We found that while the wider landscape type had no significant effect on reported bumblebee abundance, the local proximity to flowers had a significant effect (fewer bumblebees where other flowers were reported to be >5m away from the focal plant). However, the rate of mis-identifcation, revealed by photographs uploaded by participants and a photo-based quiz, was high.   Conclusions / Significance Our citizen science results support recent research on the importance of local flocal resources on pollinator abundance. Timed counts of insects visiting a lure plant is potentially an effective approach for standardised pollinator monitoring, engaging a large number of participants with a simple protocol. However, the relatively high rate of mis-identifications (compared to reports from previous pollinator citizen science projects) highlights the importance of investing in resources to train volunteers. Also, to be a scientifically valid method for enquiry, citizen science data needs to be sufficiently high quality, so receiving supporting evidence (such as photographs) would allow this to be tested and for records to be verified.},

   abstract = {Data streams arising from citizen reporting activities continue to grow, yet the information content within these streams remains unclear, and methods for addressing the inherent reporting biases little developed. Here, we quantify the major influence of physical insect features (colour, size, morphology, pattern) on the propensity of citizens to upload photographic sightings to online portals, and hence to contribute to biosecurity surveillance. After correcting for species availability, we show that physical features and pestiness are major predictors of reporting probability. The more distinctive the visual features, the higher the reporting probabilities—potentially providing useful surveillance should the species be an unwanted exotic. Conversely, the reporting probability for many small, nondescript high priority pest species is unlikely to be sufficient to contribute meaningfully to biosecurity surveillance, unless they are causing major harm. The lack of citizen reporting of recent incursions of small, nondescript exotic pests supports the model. By examining the types of insects of concern, industries or environmental managers can assess to what extent they can rely on citizen reporting for their surveillance needs. The citrus industry, for example, probably cannot rely on passive unstructured citizen data streams for surveillance of the Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri). In contrast, the forestry industry may consider that citizen detection and reporting of species of the large and colourful insects such as pine sawyers (Monochamus spp.) may be sufficient for their needs. Incorporating citizen surveillance into the general surveillance framework is an area for further research.},

These data were gathered with occurrences form various sources (GBIF, literature) to calibrate a species niche model and assess potential current BMSB range. We evaluated the potential changes to the BMSB range due to climate change by projecting the model according to 6 global circulation models (GCM) and the shared socio-economic pathways SSP245 in two time periods 2021–2040 and 2041–2060. Citizen science allowed to track BMSB expansion in France and provided information about its phenology and its habitat preferences. The model highlighted the potential for further range expansion in Europe and illustrated the impact of climate change. These results could help managing the current BMSB invasion and the framework of this survey could contribute to a better preparedness of phytosanitary authorities either for the BMSB or other invasive pests.},

We aimed to study the relations between the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) derived from this signal, and photosynthelic radiation-use efficiency (defined as net CO2 assimilation rate/incident photon flux density) in a cereal canopy. Measurements of reflectance, fluorescence, gas exchange and xanthophyll cycle pigments were made in the morning, midday and afternoon in barley canopies with two levels of nitrogen fertilization. The photosynthetic radiation-use efficiency decreased at midday, mainly in the third leaf, in both treatments, with lower values for the nitrogen deficient leaves. The zeaxanthin content showed the inverse pattern increasing at midday and in the nitrogen deficient treatment. The photosynthetic radiation-use efficiency was well correlated with the epoxidation state, EPS (violaxanthin + 0.5 antheraxanthin)/(violaxanthin + antheraxanthin + zeaxanthin). The PRI [here defined as (R539 - R570)/(R539 + R570)] was significantly correlated with epoxidaion state and zeaxanthin and with photosynthetic radiation-use efficiency. These results validate the utility of PRI in the assessment of radiation-use efficiency at canopy level.},

Subjected to persistent climate warming, it is vital to understand how these factors affect vegetation properties. Here, we studied 72 vegetation plots across three sites located in the Western Swiss Alps, characterized by high geomorphological variability and plant diversity. For each plot, vascular plant species were inventoried and ground surface temperature, soil moisture, topographic variables, earth surface processes (ESPs) and landform morphodynamics were assessed. The relationships between plant communities and environmental variables were analysed using non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS) and multivariate regression techniques (generalized linear model, GLM, and generalized additive model, GAM). Landform morphodynamics, growing degree days (sum of degree days above 5°C) and mean ground surface temperature were the most important explanatory variables of plant community composition. Furthermore, the regression models for species cover and species richness were significantly improved by adding a morphodynamics variable. This study provides complementary support that landform morphodynamics is a key factor, combined with growing degree days, to explain alpine plant distribution and community composition. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Responding to observed changes in plant species richness on high peaks of the European Alps, an extensive setup of 1m × 1m permanent plots was established at the alpine-nival ecotone (between 2900 and 3450m) on Mount Schrankogel, a GLORIA master site in the central Tyrolean Alps, Austria, in 1994. Recording was repeated in a representative selection of 362 quadrats in 2004. Ten years after the first recording, we observed an average change in vascular plant species richness from 11.4 to 12.7 species per plot, an increase of 11.8% (or of at least 10.6% at a 95% confidence level). The increase in species richness involved 23 species (about 43% of all taxa found at the ecotone), comprising both alpine and nival species and was pronouncedly higher in plots with subnival/nival vegetation than in plots with alpine grassland vegetation. Only three species showed a decrease in plot occupancy: one was an annual species, one was rare, and one a common nival plant that decreased in one part of the area but increased in the uppermost part. Species cover changed in relation to altitudinal preferences of species, showing significant declines of all subnival to nival plants, whereas alpine pioneer species increased in cover. Recent climate warming in the Alps, which has been twice as high as the global average, is considered to be the primary driver of the observed differential changes in species cover. Our results indicate an ongoing range contraction of subnival to nival species at their rear (i.e. lower) edge and a concurrent expansion of alpine pioneer species at their leading edge. Although this was expected from predictive distribution models and different temperature-related habitat preferences of alpine and nival species, we provide first evidence on -most likely -warming-induced species declines in the high European Alps. The projected acceleration of climate warming raises concerns that this phenomenon could become the major threat to biodiversity in high mountains. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {Models of the geographic distributions of species have wide application in ecology. But the nonspatial, single-level, regression models that ecologists have often employed do not deal with problems of irregular sampling intensity or spatial dependence, and do not adequately quantify uncertainty. We show here how to build statistical models that can handle these features of spatial prediction and provide richer, more powerful inference about species niche relations, distributions, and the effects of human disturbance. We begin with a familiar generalized linear model and build in additional features, including spatial random effects and hierarchical levels. Since these models are fully specified statistical models, we show that it is possible to add complexity without sacrificing interpretability. This step-by-step approach, together with attached code that implements a simple, spatially explicit, regression model, is structured to facilitate self-teaching. All models are developed in a Bayesian framework. We assess the performance of the models by using them to predict the distributions of two plant species (Proteaceae) from South Africa's Cape Floristic Region. We demonstrate that making distribution models spatially explicit can be essential for accurately characterizing the environmental response of species, predicting their probability of occurrence, and assessing uncertainty in the model results. Adding hierarchical levels to the models has further advantages in allowing human transformation of the landscape to be taken into account, as well as additional features of the sampling process. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Specialised SDM packages solve this problem by providing a simpler, unified interface by wrapping the original functions to tackle each specific requirement. However, creating and maintaining such interfaces is time-consuming, and with this approach, the user cannot easily integrate other methods that may become available. Here, we present tidysdm, an R package that solves this problem by taking advantage of the tidymodels universe. tidymodels provide standardised grammar, data structures and modelling interfaces, and a well-documented infrastructure to integrate new algorithms and metrics. The wide adoption of tidymodels means that most ML algorithms and metrics are already integrated, and the user can add additional ones. Moreover, because of the broad adoption of tidymodels, new statistical approaches tend to be implemented quickly, making them easily integrated into existing pipelines and analyses. tidysdm takes advantage of the tidymodels universe to provide a flexible and fully customisable pipeline to fit SDM. It includes SDM-specific algorithms and metrics, and methods to facilitate the use of spatial data within tidymodels. Additionally, tidysdm is the first software that natively allows SDM to be performed using data from different periods, expanding the availability of SDM for scholars working in palaeontology, archaeology, palaeobiology, palaeoecology and other disciplines focussing on the past.},

   abstract = {Evaluating models fit to data with internal spatial structure requires specific cross-validation (CV) approaches, because randomly selecting assessment data may produce assessment sets that are not truly independent of data used to train the model. Many spatial CV methodologies have been proposed to address this by forcing models to extrapolate spatially when predicting the assessment set. However, to date there exists little guidance on which methods yield the most accurate estimates of model performance. We conducted simulations to compare model performance estimates produced by five common CV methods fit to spatially structured data. We found spatial CV approaches generally improved upon resubstitution and V-fold CV estimates, particularly when approaches which combined assessment sets of spatially conjunct observations with spatial exclusion buffers. To facilitate use of these techniques, we introduce the `spatialsample` package which provides tooling for performing spatial CV as part of the broader tidymodels modeling framework.},

   abstract = {Bamboos are typical examples of highly synchronized semelparous species. Their mass-flowering events occur at supra-annual intervals but they sometimes flower on a small scale in off-years. If some bamboo ramets (culms) of a genet flower and die in off-years, whereas other culms of the same genet do not flower synchronously, the genet can still survive blooming in an off-year and could participate in the next mass-flowering event. At genet level, the effect might be similar to that achieved by synchronously reproducing iteroparous plants. In addition, if multiple genets flower simultaneously in off-years, cross-pollination will be promoted. However, it is not known whether all the culms in a genet flower synchronously and whether multiple genets flower in off-years. We determined the clonal structure of three temperate dwarf bamboo species, i.e., Sasa senanensis, S. kurilensis, and S. palmata, at 24 off-year flowering sites and the surrounding areas in northern Japan using seven microsatellite markers. We also estimated seed set at seven of the sites and self-pollination rates at five sites to determine off-year reproductive success. Next, we investigated whether seed sets at the culm level were related to flowering area and/or number of flowering genets, using generalized linear mixed-effect models (GLMMs). Multiple genets flowered at 9/24 flowering sites. We found that 40/96 of the genets identified had some flowering culms. Non-flowering culms were present in 24/40 flowering genets. Seed set was in the range 2.2%–12.5% and the self-pollination rate was 96.3%. In the best GLMM, seed set increased with flowering area. Seeds were produced in off-years, but cross-pollination was rare in off-years. We suggest that some dwarf bamboos may exhibit iteroparity or imperfectly synchronized semelparity at the genet level, a characteristic similar to that of other reproductively synchronous plants. We also found synchronous flowering of a few genets even in off-years.},

   abstract = {Dwarf bamboos in the genus Sasa are believed to be long-lived, synchronously flowering, and monocarpic plants. However, the monocarpy of dwarf bamboo has not been confirmed, because whether all ramets within one genet flower at the same time cannot be determined without differentiating the genetic structure among ramets. This study aims to evaluate the reproductive traits of Sasa pubiculmis by verifying the monocarpy and physiological integration between flowering ramets and non-flowering ramets during a 4-year flowering period. One genotypically identified genet, which covered an area of approximately 3 ha, had both flowering and non-flowering patches of ramets during the 4-year flowering period (2004-2007). A fraction of the flowering genet remained non-flowering during the 4 years of observation, and did not die after mass flowering. Flowering ramets were physically connected to non-flowering ramets via rhizomes, and assimilated 13C was allocated from non-flowering ramets to flowering ramets. Consequently, we clarified that this dwarf bamboo potentially has polycarpic reproductive traits rather than monocarpic, and a genet can keep rhizomes and non-flowering patches alive to sustain the organism after mass flowering. © The Botanical Society of Japan and Springer 2009.},

@article{Allouche2006TSS,
   abstract = {1. In recent years the use of species distribution models by ecologists and conservation managers has increased considerably, along with an awareness of the need to provide accuracy assessment for predictions of such models. The kappa statistic is the most widely used measure for the performance of models generating presence-absence predictions, but several studies have criticized it for being inherently dependent on prevalence, and argued that this dependency introduces statistical artefacts to estimates of predictive accuracy. This criticism has been supported recently by computer simulations showing that kappa responds to the prevalence of the modelled species in a unimodal fashion. 2. In this paper we provide a theoretical explanation for the observed dependence of kappa on prevalence, and introduce into ecology an alternative measure of accuracy, the true skill statistic (TSS), which corrects for this dependence while still keeping all the advantages of kappa. We also compare the responses of kappa and TSS to prevalence using empirical data, by modelling distribution patterns of 128 species of woody plant in Israel. 3. The theoretical analysis shows that kappa responds in a unimodal fashion to variation in prevalence and that the level of prevalence that maximizes kappa depends on the ratio between sensitivity (the proportion of correctly predicted presences) and specificity (the proportion of correctly predicted absences). In contrast, TSS is independent of prevalence. 4. When the two measures of accuracy were compared using empirical data, kappa showed a unimodal response to prevalence, in agreement with the theoretical analysis. TSS showed a decreasing linear response to prevalence, a result we interpret as reflecting true ecological phenomena rather than a statistical artefact. This interpretation is supported by the fact that a similar pattern was found for the area under the ROC curve, a measure known to be independent of prevalence. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our results provide theoretical and empirical evidence that kappa, one of the most widely used measures of model performance in ecology, has serious limitations that make it unsuitable for such applications. The alternative we suggest, TSS, compensates for the shortcomings of kappa while keeping all of its advantages. We therefore recommend the TSS as a simple and intuitive measure for the performance of species distribution models when predictions are expressed as presence-absence maps. © 2006 The Authors.},

I examined the role of species interactions on the population dynamics of the herb Thalictrum alpinum and the sedge Carex vaginata by removing the dwarf shrub Dryas octopetala over four growing seasons at Finse, in the alpine region of south Norway, Furthermore, by increasing temperature (open top chambers) and nutrient availability (nutrient addition), I assessed the effects of climate warming on biotic interactions. 2. Dryas removal increased the number of Thalictrum and Carex leaves, and flowering frequency of Carex. Flower stems and leaf stalks of Thalictrum, and the leaves of Carex, became significantly shorter following Dryas removal. Warming and nutrient addition increased vegetative plant growth, whereas warming alone had positive effects on sexual reproductive effort of the target species. My results suggest that there is both competition for nutrients, and a facilitative shelter effect of Dryas on its neighbours. 3. Species interactions affected population dynamics of Thalictrum and Carex. Interactions between the impacts of Dryas removal and abiotic factors on leaf production, suggested that interactions between Dryas and neighbouring species might be modified if temperature and, in particular, nutrient availability increase under global warming. 4. This study shows that both biotic interactions and abiotic environmental conditions may affect alpine plant population dynamics. Furthermore, it shows that climate change may modify species interactions. 5.

In this study we analyze recruitment patterns of Pinus mugo Turra in different grassland communities of the Northern Calcareous Alps, Austria. Pinus mugo is the most important invader of abandoned subalpine pastures in the area and the predominant woody plant at the current timberline. Results indicate strong dependence of colonization success on propagule pressure and differential invasibility of grassland types but only a marginal impact of local-scale site conditions, at least within the species' current altitudinal distribution limits. Because the grassland matrix at and above the current treeline is dominated by a particularly invasible grassland type, a possible climate change--driven upward movement of Pinus mugo shrublands may take place quite rapidly. In contrast, encroachment on abandoned subalpine pastures is frequently delayed by competition with vigorous grassland canopies.]},

   abstract = {Alpine ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to climate change. Monitoring the distribution of alpine vegetation is required to plan practical conservation activities. However, conventional field observations, airborne and satellite remote sensing are difficult in terms of coverage, cost and resolution in alpine areas. Ground-based time-lapse cameras have been used to observe the regions' snowmelt and vegetation phenology and offer significant advantages in terms of cost, resolution and frequency. However, they have not been used in research monitoring of vegetation distribution patterns. This study proposes a novel method for drawing georeferenced vegetation classification maps from ground-based imagery of alpine regions. Our approach had two components: vegetation classification and georectification. The proposed vegetation classification method uses a pixel time series acquired from fall images, utilizing the fall leaf color patterns. We demonstrated that the performance of the vegetation classification could be improved using time-lapse imagery and a Recurrent Neural Network. We also developed a novel method to accurately transform ground-based images into georeferenced data. We propose the following approaches: (1) an automated procedure to acquire Ground Control Points and (2) a camera model that considers lens distortions for accurate georectification. We demonstrated that the proposed approach outperforms conventional methods, in addition to achieving sufficient accuracy to observe the vegetation distribution on a plant-community scale. The evaluation revealed an F1 score and root-mean-square error of 0.937 and 3.4 m in the vegetation classification and georectification, respectively. Our results highlight the potential of inexpensive time-lapse cameras to monitor the distribution of alpine vegetation. The proposed method can significantly contribute to the effective conservation planning of alpine ecosystems.},

Tall, dense clonal patches of bamboo suppress alpine plant growth, alter ecosystem functioning, and reduce diversity. We aim to assess the ecological impacts of bamboo expansion and the effectiveness of bamboo control for restoring alpine vegetation and species diversity. We quantified the extent of bamboo expansion, its effects on an alpine ecosystem, and the recovery of species diversity by bamboo removal over 6 years in Daisetsuzan National Park, northern Japan. We established paired, experimental plots assigned to either removal or control treatments following an encroaching gradient from interior to terminal locations in a large bamboo patch. We monitored bamboo development and aboveground production, and its impact on soil moisture and species diversity to assess the recovery process of snow meadow species after its removal. In control plots, bamboo density consistently increased and accumulated biomass from year to year. In the removal treatment, bamboo culm density, height and biomass decreased through time at all locations. Furthermore, soil moisture increased in the removal plots and remained consistently higher than controls throughout the growing season. Dwarf bamboo strongly suppressed alpine plants and reduced species diversity. However, alpine snow meadow species rapidly recovered and diversity increased through time in the removal treatment.

   abstract = {Unmanned aerial systems (UASs) have recently become an affordable means to map forests at the species level, but research into the performance of different classification methodologies and sensors is necessary so users can make informed choices that maximize accuracy. This study investigated whether multi-temporal UAS data improved the classified accuracy of 14 species examined the optimal time-window for data collection, and compared the performance of a consumer-grade RGB sensor to that of a multispectral sensor. A time series of UAS data was collected from early spring to mid-summer and a sequence of mono-temporal and multi-temporal classifications were carried out. Kappa comparisons were conducted to ascertain whether the multi-temporal classifications significantly improved accuracy and whether there were significant differences between the RGB and multispectral classifications. The multi-temporal classification approach significantly improved accuracy; however, there was no significant benefit when more than three dates were used. Mid- to late spring imagery produced the highest accuracies, potentially due to high spectral heterogeneity between species and homogeneity within species during this time. The RGB sensor exhibited significantly higher accuracies, probably due to the blue band, which was found to be very important for classification accuracy and lacking in the multispectral sensor employed here.},

   abstract = {One significant unanswered question about biotic responses to climate change is how plant communities within topographically complex landscapes will respond to climate change. Alpine plant communities are strongly influenced by topographic microclimates which can either buffer or compound the effects of more regional climatic changes. Here, we analyzed species changes over 20+ years in a complex alpine landscape with pronounced gradients in microtopography and consequently large variation in temperatures, snow depths, and nitrogen availability across small (10 m) scales. Using data from long-term monitoring plots from six community types, we asked how species composition and functional diversity changed over time in these different areas of the landscape, and whether fine-scale heterogeneity allowed species to move in response to temporal changes in the environment. We found site-wide patterns of increasing species and functional diversity. However, the majority of variability in composition over time was non-directional, both within and between community types. Within community types, Carex-dominated snow banks and wet meadow communities were the most variable in composition over time, while Sibbaldia-dominated snow banks, fellfield, dry meadow and moist meadow exhibited moderate change. Over forty percent of the plots also transitioned between community types during the census intervals, but these also were largely transient, with a shift occurring in one time interval and then shifting back in the next interval. Thus, even with evidence of directional change over time in climate, N deposition, and release from grazing, vegetation is tracking finer-scale variability both in time and space. Environmental heterogeneity may allow vegetation to track this finer-scale variability and enhance resilience to underlying directional changes in alpine and other topographically-complex environments. © 2013 Spasojevic et al.},

Current open-source methods facilitate one or a few of these tasks, but in many cases require manual intervention by the user, as well as associating independent processes into an overall workflow. We introduce ‘drpToolkit’, an open-source Python package that automates the workflow of data management, image alignment and data extraction from time-series image sets. The toolkit operates on a folder of images and generates an aligned image time series using a user-defined keyframe, and extracts derived greenness and snow indices from user-defined regions of interest. Imagery alignment improves the spatial consistency among images in a set and allows repeated measures within the set. Particularly among small regions of interest, data extracted from aligned imagery reflects observed changes in greenness compared to unaligned imagery. This software simplifies the process of converting raw imagery stored on an SD card to useful ecological data. It automatically refiles imagery using a standardized format used in other applications, increasing the opportunity for cross-study comparisons of phenology, and collaboration among researchers and agencies to improve understanding of fine-scale ecological response to climate change.},

In this study we tested the application of inexpensive digital visible-light cameras in monitoring phenology. A standard digital camera was mounted on a 45 m tall flux tower at the Lägeren FLUXNET/CarboEuropeIP site (Switzerland), providing hourly images of a mixed beech forest. Image analysis was conducted separately on a set of regions of interest representing two different tree species during spring in 2005 and 2006. We estimated the date of leaf emergence based on the levels of the extracted red, green and blue colors. Comparisons with validation data were in accordance with the phenology of the observed trees. The mean error of observed leaf unfolding dates compared with validation data was 3 days in 2005 and 3.6 days in 2006. An uncertainty analysis was performed and demonstrated moderate impacts on color values of changing illumination conditions due to clouds and illumination angles. We conclude that digital visible-light cameras could provide inexpensive, spatially representative and objective information with the required temporal resolution for phenological studies.

   abstract = {Digital repeat photography has the potential to become an important long-term data source for phenological research given its advantages in terms of logistics, continuity, consistency and objectivity over traditional assessments of vegetation status by human observers. Red-green-blue (RGB) color channel information from digital images can be separately extracted as digital numbers, and subsequently summarized through color indices such as excess green (ExG=2G-[R+B]) or through nonlinear transforms to chromatic coordinates or other color spaces. Previous studies have demonstrated the use of ExG and the green chromatic coordinate (gcc=G/[R+G+B]) from digital landscape image archives for tracking canopy development but several methodological questions remained unanswered. These include the effects of diurnal, seasonal and weather-related changes in scene illumination on ExG and gcc, and digital camera and image file format choice. We show that gcc is generally more effective than ExG in suppressing the effects of changes in scene illumination. To further reduce these effects we propose a moving window approach that assigns the 90th percentile of all daytime values within a three-day window to the center day (per90), resulting in three-day ExG and gcc. Using image archives from eleven forest sites in North America, we demonstrate that per90 is able to further reduce unwanted variability in ExG and gcc due to changes in scene illumination compared to previously used mean mid-day values of ExG and gcc.Comparison of eleven different digital cameras at Harvard Forest (autumn 2010) indicates that camera and image file format choice might be of secondary importance for phenological research: with the exception of inexpensive indoor webcams, autumn patterns of changes in gcc and ExG from images in common JPEG image file format were in good agreement, especially toward the end of senescence. Due to its greater effectiveness in suppressing changes in scene illumination, especially in combination with per90, we advocate the use of gcc for phenological research. Our results indicate that gcc from different digital cameras can be used for comparing the timing of key phenological events (e.g., complete leaf coloring) across sites. However, differences in how specific cameras "see" the forest canopy may obscure subtle phenological changes that could be detectable if a common protocol was implemented across sites. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Winkler2018Frontiers,
   abstract = {The spatial patterning of alpine plant communities is strongly influenced by the variation in physical factors such as temperature and moisture, which are strongly affected by snow depth and snowmelt patterns. Earlier snowmelt timing and greater soil-moisture limitations may favor wide-ranging species adapted to a broader set of ecohydrological conditions than alpine-restricted species. We asked how plant community composition, phenology, plant water relations, and photosynthetic gas exchange of alpine-restricted and wide-ranging species differ in their responses to a ca. 40-day snowmelt gradient in the Colorado Rocky Mountains (Lewisia pygmaea, Sibbaldia procumbens, and Hymenoxys grandiflora were alpine-restricted and Artemisia scopulorum, Carex rupestris, and Geum rossii were wide-ranging species). As hypothesized, species richness and foliar cover increased with earlier snowmelt, due to a greater abundance of wide-ranging species present in earlier melting plots. Flowering initiation occurred earlier with earlier snowmelt for 12 out of 19 species analyzed, while flowering duration was shortened with later snowmelt for six species (all but one were wide-ranging species). We observed >50% declines in net photosynthesis from July to September as soil moisture and plant water potentials declined. Early-season stomatal conductance was higher in wide-ranging species, indicating a more competitive strategy for water acquisition when soil moisture is high. Even so, there were no associated differences in photosynthesis or transpiration, suggesting no strong differences between these groups in physiology. Our findings reveal that plant species with different ranges (alpine-restricted vs. wide-ranging) could have differential phenological and physiological responses to snowmelt timing and associated soil moisture dry-down, and that alpine-restricted species’ performance is more sensitive to snowmelt. As a result, alpine-restricted species may serve as better indicator species than their wide-ranging heterospecifics. Overall, alpine community composition and peak % cover are strongly structured by spatio-temporal patterns in snowmelt timing. Thus, near-term, community-wide changes (or variation) in phenology and physiology in response to shifts in snowmelt timing or rates of soil dry down are likely to be contingent on the legacy of past climate on community structure.},

   abstract = {Remote sensing is an important tool for mapping and monitoring vegetation. Advances in sensor technology continually improve the information content of imagery for airborne, as well as space-borne, systems. This paper investigates whether vegetation associations can be differentiated using hyperspectral reflectance in the visible to shortwave infrared spectral range, and how well species can be separated based on their spectra. For this purpose, the field reflectance spectra of 27 saltmarsh vegetation types of the Dutch Waddenzee wetland were analysed in three steps. Prior to analysis, the spectra were smoothed with an innovative wavelet approach. In the first stage of the analysis, the reflectance spectra of the vegetation types were tested for differences between type classes. It was found that the reflectance spectra of saltmarsh vegetation types are statistically significantly different for various spectral regions. Secondly, it was tested whether this statistical difference could be enhanced by using continuum removal as a normalisation technique. For vegetation spectra, continuum removal improves the statistical difference between vegetation types in the visible spectrum, but weakens the statistical difference of the spectra in the near-infrared and shortwave infrared part of the spectrum. Thirdly, after statistical differences were found, it was determined how distant in spectral space the vegetation type classes were from each other, using the Bhattacharyya (BH) and the Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distance measures. We selected six wavelengths for this, based on the statistical analysis of the first step. The potential of correct classification of the saltmarsh vegetation types using hyperspectral remote sensing is predicted by these distance measures. It is concluded that the reflectance of vegetation types is statistically different. With high quality radiometric calibration of hyperspectral imagery, it is anticipated that vegetation species may be identified from imagery using spectral libraries that were measured in the field during the time of image acquisition. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.},

For this purpose, Hyperion, ALI, IKONOS, and ETM+ data were acquired for southern Cameroon, a region considered to be a representative area for tropical moist evergreen and semi-deciduous forests. Field data, collected in near-real time to coincide with satellite sensor overpass, were used to (1) quantify and model the biomass of tree, shrub, and weed species; and (2) characterize forest land use/land cover (LULC) classes. The study established that even the most advanced broadband sensors (i.e., ETM+, IKONOS, and ALI) had serious limitations in modeling biomass and in classifying forest LULC classes. The broadband models explained only 13-60% of the variability in biomass across primary forests, secondary forests, and fallows. The overall accuracies were between 42% and 51% for classifying nine complex rainforest LULC classes using the broadband data of these sensors. Within individual vegetation types (e.g., primary or secondary forest), the overall accuracies increased slightly, but followed a similar trend. Among the broadband sensors, ALI sensor performed better than the IKONOS and ETM+ sensors. When compared to the three broadband sensors, Hyperion narrowband data produced (1) models that explained 36-83% more of the variability in rainforest biomass, and (2) LULC classifications with 45-52% higher overall accuracies. Twenty-three Hyperion narrowbands that were most sensitive in modeling forest biomass and in classifying forest LULC classes were identified and discussed. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Question: Alpine vegetation is sensitive to climate change, with shifts in species ranges, changes in community composition, and an upward shift in the forest limit over decades. Under climate change, habitats suitable for alpine vegetation will progressively decrease in scale, making their protection and conservation particularly important. In the Taisetsu Mountains of Japan, alpine vegetation has changed remarkably during the last decade. The aim of this study was to estimate the distribution of habitats suitable for alpine and subalpine vegetation types (snowbeds, shrubs, and alpine heathland/fellfield) and competing vegetation types (Sasa spp. and subarctic forest), while considering uncertainties in future predictions and climate scenarios. Location: Taisetsu Mountains, Daisetsuzan National Park, Hokkaido (northern Japan). Methods: We estimated the habitat area suitable for each vegetation type from current vegetation maps on the basis of the predictions by three global climate models (GCMs) under two climate change scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) using five habitat suitability models (HSMs) in two periods (2046-2050 and 2096-2100). We also compared the performances of the HSMs. Results: Mean summer temperature and snow-cover period had significant effects on the distribution of all vegetation types. The estimated distribution area for suitable habitat did not differ markedly among GCMs and HSMs. Under the RCP2.6 scenario, habitats suitable for snowbeds and alpine heathland/fellfield drastically decreased overall but were preserved in some regions. Under the RCP8.5 scenario, however, subarctic forest almost completely replaced alpine and subalpine vegetation types over time. Conclusions: Our projections indicate that the severity of future climate change will determine whether or not habitats suitable for alpine vegetation will remain. Monitoring the dynamics of endemic and rare species for the effects of global warming should be the priority for adaptation strategies to enable timely conservation measures.},

This allows a direct optimisation of the word error rate, even in the absence of a lexicon or language model. The system achieves a word error rate of 27.3% on the Wall Street Journal corpus with no prior linguistic information, 21.9% with only a lexicon of allowed words, and 8.2% with a trigram language model.

The combination of these methods with the Long Short-term Memory RNN architecture has proved particularly fruitful, delivering state-of-the-art results in cursive handwriting recognition. However RNN performance in speech recognition has so far been disappointing, with better results returned by deep feedforward networks. This paper investigates deep recurrent neural networks, which combine the multiple levels of representation that have proved so effective in deep networks with the flexible use of long range context that empowers RNNs.

   abstract = {Terrestrial time-lapse photogrammetry is a rapidly growing method for deriving measurements from glacial environments because it provides high spatio-temporal resolution records of change. Currently, however, the potential usefulness of time-lapse data is limited by the unavailability of user-friendly photogrammetry toolsets. Such data are used primarily to calculate ice flow velocities or to serve as qualitative records. PyTrx (available at https://github.com/PennyHow/PyTrx) is presented here as a Python-alternative toolset to widen the range of monoscopic photogrammetry (i.e., from a single viewpoint) toolsets on offer to the glaciology community. The toolset holds core photogrammetric functions for template generation, feature-tracking, camea calibration and optimization, image registration, and georectification (using a planar projective transformation model). In addition, PyTrx facilitates areal and line measurements, which can be detected from imagery using either an automated or manual approach. Examples of PyTrx's applications are demonstrated using time-lapse imagery from Kronebreen and Tunabreen, two tidewater glaciers in Svalbard. Products from these applications include ice flow velocities, surface areas of supraglacial lakes and meltwater plumes, and glacier terminus profiles.},

   abstract = {Advancing phenology is one of the most visible effects of climate change on plant communities, and has been especially pronounced in temperature-limited tundra ecosystems. However, phenological responses have been shown to differ greatly between species, with some species shifting phenology more than others. We analysed a database of 42,689 tundra plant phenological observations to show that warmer temperatures are leading to a contraction of community-level flowering seasons in tundra ecosystems due to a greater advancement in the flowering times of late-flowering species than early-flowering species. Shorter flowering seasons with a changing climate have the potential to alter trophic interactions in tundra ecosystems. Interestingly, these findings differ from those of warmer ecosystems, where early-flowering species have been found to be more sensitive to temperature change, suggesting that community-level phenological responses to warming can vary greatly between biomes. Analysing a global database of &gt;40,000 tundra plant phenological observations monitored for up to 20 years, the authors show that community-level flowering has been contracting in response to recent warming, in contrast to findings from lower latitudes.},

   abstract = {Establishing accurate anatomical correspondences is critical for medical image registration. Although many hand-engineered features have been proposed for correspondence detection in various registration applications, no features are general enough to work well for all image data. Although many learning-based methods have been developed to help selection of best features for guiding correspondence detection across subjects with large anatomical variations, they are often limited by requiring the known correspondences (often presumably estimated by certain registration methods) as the ground truth for training. To address this limitation, we propose using an unsupervised deep learning approach to directly learn the basis filters that can effectively represent all observed image patches. Then, the coefficients by these learnt basis filters in representing the particular image patch can be regarded as the morphological signature for correspondence detection during image registration. Specifically, a stacked two-layer convolutional network is constructed to seek for the hierarchical representations for each image patch, where the high-level features are inferred from the responses of the low-level network. By replacing the hand-engineered features with our learnt data-adaptive features for image registration, we achieve promising registration results, which demonstrates that a general approach can be built to improve image registration by using data-adaptive features through unsupervised deep learning. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

Ground surface change challenges feature point detection in amount and quality, which is a common dilemma faced by feature-based registration algorithms. Under severe appearance variation, detected feature points may contain a large proportion of outliers, whereas inliers may be inadequate and unevenly distributed. This paper presents a convolutional neural network (CNN) feature-based multi-temporal remote sensing image registration method with two key contributions: (i) we use a CNN to generate robust multi-scale feature descriptors and (ii) we design a gradually increasing selection of inliers to improve the robustness of feature point registration. Extensive experiments on feature matching and image registration are performed over a multi-temporal satellite image data set and a multi-temporal unmanned aerial vehicle image dataset.

   abstract = {Environmental sustainability research is dependent on accurate land cover information. Even with the increased number of satellite systems and sensors acquiring data with improved spectral, spatial, radiometric and temporal characteristics and the new data distribution policy, most existing land cover datasets are derived from a pixel-based, single-date multi-spectral remotely sensed image with an unacceptable accuracy. One major bottleneck for accuracy improvement is how to develop an accurate and effective image classification protocol. By incorporating and utilizing multi-spectral, multi-temporal and spatial information in remote sensing images and considering the inherit spatial and sequential interdependence among neighboring pixels, we propose a new patch-based recurrent neural network (PB-RNN) system tailored for classifying multi-temporal remote sensing data. The system is designed by incorporating distinctive characteristics of multi-temporal remote sensing data. In particular, it uses multi-temporal–spectral–spatial samples and deals with pixels contaminated by clouds/shadow present in multi-temporal data series. Using a Florida Everglades ecosystem study site covering an area of 771 square kilometers, the proposed PB-RNN system has achieved a significant improvement in the classification accuracy over a pixel-based recurrent neural network (RNN) system, a pixel-based single-image neural network (NN) system, a pixel-based multi-image NN system, a patch-based single-image NN system, and a patch-based multi-image NN system. For example, the proposed system achieves 97.21% classification accuracy while the pixel-based single-image NN system achieves 64.74%. By utilizing methods like the proposed PB-RNN one, we believe that much more accurate land cover datasets can be produced over large areas.},

Recently, deep learning methods proved suitable to deal with remote sensing data mainly for scene classification(i.e., convolutional neural networks on single images) while only very few studies exist involving temporal deep learning approaches [i.e., recurrent neural networks (RNNs)] to deal with remote sensing time series. In this letter, we evaluate the ability of RNNs, in particular, the long short-term memory (LSTM) model, to perform land cover classification considering multitemporal spatial data derived from a time series of satellite images. We carried out experiments on two different data sets considering both pixel-based and object-based classifications. The obtained results show that RNNs are competitive compared with the state-of-the-art classifiers, and may outperform classical approaches in the presence of low represented and/or highly mixed classes. We also show that the alternative feature representation generated by LSTM can improve the performances of standard classifiers.},

This new approach is intended to reduce the number of generations required for convergence to the optimum. Reducing the number of generations, i.e., the time complexity of the algorithm, is important if a large population size is desired: (1) to reduce the effect of noise; (2) to improve global search properties; and (3) to implement the algorithm on (highly) parallel machines. Our method results in a highly parallel algorithm which scales favorably with large numbers of processors. This is accomplished by efficiently incorporating the available information from a large population, thus significantly reducing the number of generations needed to adapt the covariance matrix. The original version of the CMA-ES was designed to reliably adapt the covariance matrix in small populations but it cannot exploit large populations efficiently. Our modifications scale up the efficiency to population sizes of up to 10n, where n is the problem dimension. This method has been applied to a large number of test problems, demonstrating that in many cases the CMA-ES can be advanced from quadratic to linear time complexity.},

(1) It is end-to-end trainable, in contrast to most of the existing algorithms
whose components are separately trained and tuned. (2) It naturally handles
sequences in arbitrary lengths, involving no character segmentation or
horizontal scale normalization. (3) It is not confined to any predefined
lexicon and achieves remarkable performances in both lexicon-free and
lexicon-based scene text recognition tasks. (4) It generates an effective yet
much smaller model, which is more practical for real-world application
scenarios. The experiments on standard benchmarks, including the IIIT-5K,
Street View Text and ICDAR datasets, demonstrate the superiority of the

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

@article{Alcantarilla2013AKAZE,
   abstract = {We propose a novel and fast multiscale feature detection and description approach that exploits the benefits of nonlinear scale spaces. Previous attempts to detect and describe features in nonlinear scale spaces such as KAZE [1] and BFSIFT [6] are highly time consuming due to the computational burden of creating the nonlinear scale space. In this paper we propose to use recent numerical schemes called Fast Explicit Diffusion (FED) [3, 4] embedded in a pyramidal framework to dramatically speed-up feature detection in nonlinear scale spaces. In addition, we introduce a Modified-Local Difference Binary (M-LDB) descriptor that is highly efficient, exploits gradient information from the nonlinear scale space, is scale and rotation invariant and has low storage requirements. Our features are called Accelerated-KAZE (A-KAZE) due to the dramatic speed-up introduced by FED schemes embedded in a pyramidal framework. 1 Accelerated KAZE Features Building the nonlinear scale space. We use FED schemes for building a nonlinear scale space from which we can detect and describe features. By means of FED schemes, a nonlinear scale space can be built much faster than with any other kind of discretization scheme. Furthermore, FED schemes are extremely easy to implement and are more accurate than revious approaches such as Additive Operator Splitting (AOS) [7]. The main idea is to perform M cycles of n explicit diffusion steps with varying step sizes τ j that originate from the factorization of a box filter: τ j = τ max 2 cos 2 π 2 j+1 4n+2 (1) Feature Detection. We compute the determinant of the Hessian for each of the filtered images L i in the nonlinear scale space. The set of differential multiscale operators are normalized with respect to scale, using a normalized scale factor that takes into account the octave of each particular image in the nonlinear scale space. Then, we search for maxima of the detector response in scale and spatial location. L i Hessian = σ 2 i,norm L i xx L i yy − L i xy L i xy. (2) Feature Description. We propose a Modified-Local Difference Binary (M-LDB) that exploits gradient and intensity information from the nonlinear scale space. The LDB descriptor was introduced in [8] and follows the same principle as BRIEF [2], but using binary tests between the average of areas instead of single pixels for additional robustness. In addition to the intensity values, the mean of the horizontal and vertical derivatives in the areas being compared is used, resulting in 3 bits per comparison. Rotation invariance is obtained by estimating the main orientation of the keypoint as in KAZE, and the grid of LDB rotated accordingly. Instead of using the average of all pixels inside each subdivision of the grid, we subsample the grids in steps that are a function of the scale σ of the feature. The scale-dependent sampling in turn makes the descriptor robust to changes in scale. 2 Evaluation We present an extensive evaluation based on the standard Oxford benchmark [5] that shows the excellent compromise between speed and performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods such as BRISK, ORB, SURF, SIFT and KAZE. While A-KAZE is more expensive to compute than BRISK and ORB, it is faster than SURF, SIFT and KAZE. More specifically, A-KAZE is several orders of magnitude faster (a) LDB binary test (b) M-LDB binary test Figure 1: LDB [8] and proposed M-LDB binary tests between grid divisions around a keypoint, shown for the intensity and the gradients in x.

In addition, due to the use of binary descriptors the matching step can be computed very efficiently using the Hamming distance. (a) (b) Figure 2: Descriptor and timing evaluation.

   abstract = {Near surface (i.e., camera) and satellite remote sensing metrics have become widely used indicators of plant growing seasons. While robust linkages have been established between field metrics and ecosystem exchange in many land cover types, assessment of how well remotely-derived season start and end dates depict field conditions in arid ecosystems remain unknown. We evaluated the correspondence between field measures of start (SOS; leaves unfolded and canopy greenness &gt;0) and end of season (EOS) and canopy greenness for two widespread species in southwestern U.S. ecosystems with those metrics estimated from near-surface cameras and MODIS NDVI for five years (2012–2016). Using Timesat software to estimate SOS and EOS from the phenocam green chromatic coordinate (GCC) greenness index resulted in good agreement with ground observations for honey mesquite but not black grama. Despite differences in the detectability of SOS and EOS for the two species, GCC was significantly correlated with field estimates of canopy greenness for both species throughout the growing season. MODIS NDVI for this arid grassland site was driven by the black grama signal although a mesquite signal was discernable in average rainfall years. Our findings suggest phenocams could help meet myriad needs in natural resource management.},

The distribution of P. pumila is strongly related to the distribution of snow, and shoot growth is also sensitive to weather conditions. Changes in temperature and snowmelt regimes may well affect the distribution patterns of the krummholz zone. P. pumila usually occupies the habitat between the fellfield and snowbed communities, and responses to climate change may differ depending on whether plants are close to the fellfield or the snowbed. We compared the distribution and shoot growth patterns of P. pumila close to both surrounding ecosystems in the Taisetsu Mountains, northern Japan. P. pumila has expanded its distribution area by 14 % toward both edges over the last 32 years. Annual shoot growth was positively affected by summer temperature and sunshine duration, but negatively related to spring temperature toward the fellfield side. Shoot growth was greater at the southeastern edge of patches, where snowdrifts were formed. The results indicated that shoot growth and distribution area increased in warm summers. However, warm springs might have a negative influence on shoot growth, probably because the earlier reduction in cold-resistance enhances the risk of frost damage in spring close to the fellfield side. This study suggests the importance of understanding the site-specific responses of shrubs to predict the impacts of climate change on alpine ecosystems.},

   abstract = {Recent years have seen a surge of interest in understanding patterns and processes of plant invasions into mountains. Here, we synthesise current knowledge about the spread of non-native plants along elevation gradients, emphasising the current status and impacts that these species have in alpine ecosystems. Globally, invasions along elevation gradients are influenced by propagule availability, environmental constraints on population growth, evolutionary change and biotic interactions. The highest elevations are so far relatively free from non-native plants. Nonetheless, in total nearly 200 non-native plant species have been recorded from alpine environments around the world. However, we identified only three species as specifically cold-adapted, with the overwhelming majority having their centres of distribution under warmer environments, and few have substantial impacts on native communities. A combination of low propagule availability and low invasibility likely explain why alpine environments host few non-native plants relative to lowland ecosystems. However, experiences in some areas demonstrate that alpine ecosystems are not inherently resistant to invasions. Furthermore, they will face increasing pressure from the introduction of pre-adapted species, climate change, and the range expansion of native species, which are already causing concern in some areas. Nonetheless, because they are still relatively free from non-native plants, preventative action could be an effective way to limit future impacts of invasions in alpine environments.},

   abstract = {The objective of stereo camera calibration is to estimate the internal and external parameters of each camera. Using these parameters, the 3-D position of a point in the scene, which is identified and matched in two stereo images, can be determined by the method of triangulation. In this paper, we present a camera model that accounts for major sources of camera distortion, namely, radial, decentering, and thin prism distortions. The proposed calibration procedure consists of two steps. In the first step, the calibration parameters are estimated using a closed-form solution based on a distortion-free camera model. In the second step, the parameters estimated in the first step are improved iteratively through a nonlinear optimization, taking into account camera distortions. According to minimum variance estimation, the objective function to be minimized is the mean-square discrepancy between the observed image points and their inferred image projections computed with the estimated calibration parameters. We introduce a type of measure that can be used to directly evaluate the performance of calibration and compare calibrations among different systems. The validity and performance of our calibration procedure are tested with both synthetic data and real images taken by tele-and wide-angle lenses. The results consistently show significant improvements over less complete camera models.},

The camera setup is often cost-effective and simple, allowing for a large amount of data to be accumulated over a variety of environments for relatively minimal effort.

The post-processing requires a significant amount of steps to transform images into meaningful data for quantitative analysis, such as velocity fields. To the best of our knowledge at present a complete, openly available package that encompasses georeferencing, georectification and feature tracking of terrestrial, oblique images is still absent. This study presents a complete, yet adaptable, opensource package developed in MATLAB, that addresses and combines each of these post-processing steps into one complete suite in the form of an "Image GeoRectification and Feature Tracking" (ImGRAFT: http://imgraft.glaciology.net) toolbox. The toolbox can also independently produce other useful outputs, such as viewsheds, georectified and orthorectified images. ImGRAFT is primarily focused on terrestrial oblique images, for which there are currently limited post-processing options available.

   abstract = {Local parameters for climate modelling are highly dependent on crop types and their phenological growth stage. The land cover change of agricultural areas during the growing season provides important information to distinguish crop types. The presented progressive classification algorithm identifies crop types based on their phenological development and their corresponding reflectance characteristics in multitemporal satellite images of the four sensors Landsat-7 and -8, Sentinel-2A and RapidEye. It distinguishes crop types not only retrospectively, but progressively during the growing season starting in early spring. Binary fuzzy c-means clustering differentiates seven crop types in eight decisions at particular time periods. These decisions are based on expert knowledge about plant characteristics in different phenological stages. The unsupervised classification approach and previously defined decisions enable the algorithm to work independently of training data. The fuzzy approach provides certainties of crop-type existence and generates first results in early spring. The accuracy and reliability of the classification results improve with increasing time. The method is developed at the German Durable Environmental Multidisciplinary Monitoring Information Network (DEMMIN). The study area is an official test site of the Joint Experiment of Crop Assessment and Monitoring (JECAM) and is located in an intensely agricultural used area in Northern Germany. Classification results were produced for the growing seasons 2015 and 2016. The overall accuracy in 2015 amounted to 89.49%. A challenge remains the distinct separation of wheat and rye, whereas barley, rapeseed, potato, corn and sugar beet are classified with high accuracies. The overall accuracy in 2016 was lower (77.19%) due to unfavourable weather conditions.},

This study aimed to develop a phenology-based classification approach for the assessment of rice cropping systems in Mekong Delta, Vietnam, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The data were processed from December 2000, to December 2012, using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) in three main steps: (1) data pre-processing to construct the smooth MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI)  time-series data; (2) rice crop classification; and (3) accuracy assessment. The comparisons between the classification maps and the ground reference data indicated overall accuracies and Kappa coefficients, respectively, of 81.4% and 0.75 for 2002, 80.6% and 0.74 for 2006 and 85.5% and 0.81 for 2012. The results by comparisons between MODIS-derived rice area and rice area statistics were slightly overestimated, with a relative error in area (REA) from 0.9–15.9%. There was, however, a close correlation between the two datasets  (R2 ≥ 0.89). From 2001 to 2012, the areas of triple-cropped rice increased approximately 31.6%, while those of the single-cropped rain-fed rice, double-cropped irrigated rice and double-cropped rain-fed rice decreased roughly −5.0%, −19.2% and −7.4%, respectively. This study demonstrates the validity of such an approach for rice-crop monitoring with MODIS data and could be transferable to other regions.},

   abstract = {Global climate change and sustained urban growth have increased the necessity of assessing the role that urban vegetation plays in urban dwellers' lives, as well as in urban ecosystem services. Urban environmental studies, however, still lack methods to characterize urban vegetation with adequate detail and across large areas. To remedy this gap, we apply a Support-Vector-Machine approach to classify eight frequent tree genera in the capital city of Berlin, Germany. We investigate different spectral and temporal band combinations of five RapidEye images acquired during the 2009 phenological season, and use ancillary surface and terrain models for orthorectification and improved tree masking. Results show that intra-annual time-series of RapidEye data can be used for high-precision tree genera classification in an urban environment. Differences within RapidEye time-series correlate well with empirical phenological studies of different tree genera, and RapidEye's red-edge band supports class separability. Further assessment is needed on the individual tree level and mixed stands regarding the quality of mapping urban individual trees, as our sampling approach mainly focused on larger stands with only a single tree genus. Urban applications will benefit from multitemporal RapidEye data, which offers area-wide monitoring and allows in-depth vegetation analysis to augment existing assessments. Such information is indispensable for assessing differences in urban ecosystem services related to carbon storage, cooling or air filtering, all of which differ between tree species. Therefore, the importance of in-depth analyses of urban vegetation cannot be underestimated in today's context of climate change. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Recently, a dwarf bamboo species, Sasa kurilensis; Poaceae, has invaded into alpine snow-meadows in the wilderness area of the Taisetsu Mountains, northern Japan. This dwarf bamboo species has a wide distribution range from lowland to alpine sites of snowy regions. Because of the formation of dense evergreen culms and an extensive rhizome system, other plants are excluded following invasion by this dwarf bamboo, resulting in low species diversity. Dwarf bamboo originally inhabited the leeward slopes of alpine dwarf pine (Pinus pumila) clumps in alpine regions. During the last 32 years, however, dwarf bamboo has expanded its distribution area by up to 47% toward snow-meadows, especially on southeastern facing slopes. This rapid change may be related to the decrease in soil moisture and expansion of the annual growing period caused by the recent acceleration of snowmelt time. A multiyear census revealed that the density of bamboo culms increased 30-150% during 2 years, and the annual expansion of bamboo rhizomes was 39 cmon average. In addition to the expansion of bamboo clumps by vegetative growth, the possibility of migration by seed dispersal was also suggested by a genet analysis. With the increase in culm density, the species richness of snow-meadow vegetation decreased to less than one-quarter of the original level due to intense shading by dwarf bamboo. The rapid vegetation change in these almost pristine alpine environments isolated from the human activity implies that global climate change already influences the alpine ecosystem. © 2011 The Authors.},

This paper presents a new similarity measure for identifying plants based on the use of an unsupervised distance learning scheme, instead of using traditional approaches based on pairwise similarities. We experimentally show that its use yields considerable improvements in time-series search tasks. In addition, we also demonstrate how the late fusion of different time series can improve the results on plant species identification.

As its distance measure, k-Shape uses a normalized version of the cross-correlation measure in order to consider the shapes of time series while comparing them. Based on the properties of that distance measure, we develop a method to compute cluster centroids, which are used in every iteration to update the assignment of time series to clusters. To demonstrate the robustness of k-Shape, we perform an extensive experimental evaluation of our approach against partitional, hierarchical, and spectral clustering methods, with combinations of the most competitive distance measures. k-Shape outperforms all scalable approaches in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, k-Shape also outperforms all non-scalable (and hence impractical) combinations , with one exception that achieves similar accuracy results. However, unlike k-Shape, this combination requires tuning of its distance measure and is two orders of magnitude slower than k-Shape. Overall, k-Shape emerges as a domain-independent, highly accurate, and highly efficient clustering approach for time series with broad applications.},

@article{Prasad2020VariationalClustering,
   abstract = {Recent advances in deep learning have shown their ability to learn strong feature representations for images. The task of image clustering naturally requires good feature representations to capture the distribution of the data and subsequently differentiate data points from one another. Often these two aspects are dealt with independently and thus traditional feature learning alone does not suffice in partitioning the data meaningfully. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) naturally lend themselves to learning data distributions in a latent space. Since we wish to efficiently discriminate between different clusters in the data, we propose a method based on VAEs where we use a Gaussian Mixture prior to help cluster the images accurately. We jointly learn the parameters of both the prior and the posterior distributions. Our method represents a true Gaussian Mixture VAE. This way, our method simultaneously learns a prior that captures the latent distribution of the images and a posterior to help discriminate well between data points. We also propose a novel reparametrization of the latent space consisting of a mixture of discrete and continuous variables. One key takeaway is that our method generalizes better across different datasets without using any pre-training or learnt models, unlike existing methods, allowing it to be trained from scratch in an end-to-end manner. We verify our efficacy and generalizability experimentally by achieving state-of-the-art results among unsupervised methods on a variety of datasets. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to pursue image clustering using VAEs in a purely unsupervised manner on real image datasets.},

We begin by reviewing a well-known measure of partition correspondence often attributed to Rand (1971), discuss the issue of correcting this index for chance, and note that a recent normalization strategy developed by Morey and Agresti (1984) and adopted by others (e.g., Miligan and Cooper 1985) is based on an incorrect assumption. Then, the general problem of comparing partitions is approached indirectly by assessing the congruence of two proximity matrices using a simple cross-product measure. They are generated from corresponding partitions using various scoring rules. Special cases derivable include traditionally familiar statistics and/or ones tailored to weight certain object pairs differentially. Finally, we propose a measure based on the comparison of object triples having the advantage of a probabilistic interpretation in addition to being corrected for chance (i.e., assuming a constant value under a reasonable null hypothesis) and bounded between ±1.},

a method for explicitly disentangling image rotation and translation from other

formulating the generative model as a function of the spatial coordinate, we
make the reconstruction error differentiable with respect to latent translation

to perform approximate inference on these latent variables while explicitly
constraining them to only represent rotation and translation. We demonstrate
that this framework, termed spatial-VAE, effectively learns latent
representations that disentangle image rotation and translation from content

including applications to modeling continuous 2-D views of proteins from single

   abstract = {Terrestrial photography combined with the recently presented Photo Rectification And ClassificaTIon SoftwarE (PRACTISE V.1.0) has proven to be a valuable source to derive snow cover maps in a high temporal and spatial resolution. The areal coverage of the used digital photographs is however strongly limited. Satellite images on the other hand can cover larger areas but do show uncertainties with respect to the accurate detection of the snow covered area. This is especially the fact if user defined thresholds are needed, e.g. in case of the frequently used normalized-difference snow index (NDSI). The definition of this value is often not adequately defined by either a general value from literature or over the impression of the user, but not by reproducible independent information. PRACTISE V.2.1 addresses this important aspect and shows additional improvements. The Matlab-based software is now able to automatically process and detect snow cover in satellite images. A simultaneously captured camera-derived snow cover map is in this case utilized as in situ information for calibrating the NDSI threshold value. Moreover, an additional automatic snow cover classification, specifically developed to classify shadow-affected photographs, was included. The improved software was tested for photographs and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) as well as Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) scenes in the Zugspitze massif (Germany). The results show that using terrestrial photography in combination with satellite imagery can lead to an objective, reproducible, and user-independent derivation of the NDSI threshold and the resulting snow cover map. The presented method is not limited to the sensor system or the threshold used in here but offers manifold application options for other scientific branches.},

cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image
classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14

We found that closed-canopy coniferous forest, broadleaf deciduous forest, and mixedwood forest increased on an area basis by 35%, 45%, and 80%, respectively, over this time period; concomitantly, grasslands and open-canopy woodlands declined by 25% and 39%, respectively. Overall, 28% of the landscape was in a more advanced successional state in 2008 as compared to the early twentieth century. The Montane and Subalpine Natural Subregions (NSR) experienced the most change (42% and 26%, respectively, in a more advanced successional state). The loss of open-canopy woodlands was observed across the entire landscape, while grassland and meadow losses were most acute in the Subalpine and Alpine NSRs. The probability of vegetation change to a more advanced successional condition was greater at higher elevations and in areas receiving lower amounts of solar insolation. The changes observed are consistent with what we would expect to see due to lengthening of fire return intervals. Understanding the magnitude of change in vegetation types and the drivers of this change is important for the development of effective contemporary ecosystem management and restoration practices.},

This article therefore provides an overview of machine learning from an applied perspective. We focus on the relatively mature methods of support vector machines, single decision trees (DTs), Random Forests, boosted DTs, artificial neural networks, and k-nearest neighbours (k-NN). Issues considered include the choice of algorithm, training data requirements, user-defined parameter selection and optimization, feature space impacts and reduction, and computational costs. We illustrate these issues through applying machine-learning classification to two publically available remotely sensed data sets.},

   abstract = {Shifts in vegetation phenology are a key example of the biological effects of climate change1–3. However, there is substantial uncertainty about whether these temperature-driven trends will continue, or whether other factors—for example, photoperiod—will become more important as warming exceeds the bounds of historical variability4,5. Here we use phenological transition dates derived from digital repeat photography6 to show that experimental whole-ecosystem warming treatments7 of up to +9 °C linearly correlate with a delayed autumn green-down and advanced spring green-up of the dominant woody species in a boreal Picea–Sphagnum bog. Results were confirmed by direct observation of both vegetative and reproductive phenology of these and other bog plant species, and by multiple years of observations. There was little evidence that the observed responses were constrained by photoperiod. Our results indicate a likely extension of the period of vegetation activity by 1–2 weeks under a ‘CO2 stabilization’ climate scenario (+2.6 ± 0.7 °C), and 3–6 weeks under a ‘high-CO2 emission’ scenario (+5.9 ± 1.1 °C), by the end of the twenty-first century. We also observed severe tissue mortality in the warmest enclosures after a severe spring frost event. Failure to cue to photoperiod resulted in precocious green-up and a premature loss of frost hardiness8, which suggests that vulnerability to spring frost damage will increase in a warmer world9,10. Vegetation strategies that have evolved to balance tradeoffs associated with phenological temperature tracking may be optimal under historical climates, but these strategies may not be optimized for future climate regimes. These in situ experimental results are of particular importance because boreal forests have both a circumpolar distribution and a key role in the global carbon cycle11. Experimental whole-ecosystem warming treatments of a Picea–Sphagnum peat bog reveal the likely phenological consequences of future temperature increases that exceed those of historical climate regimes.},

Phenology is also highly sensitive to climate change and variability. Here we present a series of datasets, together consisting of almost 750 years of observations, characterizing vegetation phenology in diverse ecosystems across North America. Our data are derived from conventional, visible-wavelength, automated digital camera imagery collected through the PhenoCam network. For each archived image, we extracted RGB (red, green, blue) colour channel information, with means and other statistics calculated across a region-of-interest (ROI) delineating a specific vegetation type. From the high-frequency (typically, 30 min) imagery, we derived time series characterizing vegetation colour, including “canopy greenness”, processed to 1- and 3-day intervals. For ecosystems with one or more annual cycles of vegetation activity, we provide estimates, with uncertainties, for the start of the “greenness rising” and end of the “greenness falling” stages. The database can be used for phenological model validation and development, evaluation of satellite remote sensing data products, benchmarking earth system models, and studies of climate change impacts on terrestrial ecosystems.

   abstract = {There is a need to document how plant phenology is responding to global change factors, particularly warming trends. "Near-surface" remote sensing, using radiometric instruments or imaging sensors, has great potential to improve phenological monitoring because automated observations can be made at high temporal frequency. Here we build on previous work and show how inexpensive, networked digital cameras ("webcams") can be used to document spatial and temporal variation in the spring and autumn phenology of forest canopies. We use two years of imagery from a deciduous, northern hardwood site, and one year of imagery from a coniferous, boreal transition site. A quantitative signal is obtained by splitting images into separate red, green, and blue color channels and calculating the relative brightness of each channel for "regions of interest" within each image. We put the observed phenological signal in context by relating it to seasonal patterns of gross primary productivity, inferred from eddy covariance measurements of surface-atmosphere CO2 exchange. We show that spring increases, and autumn decreases, in canopy greenness can be detected in both deciduous and coniferous stands. In deciduous stands, an autumn red peak is also observed. The timing and rate of spring development and autumn senescence varies across the canopy, with greater variability in autumn than spring. Interannual variation in phenology can be detected both visually and quantitatively; delayed spring onset in 2007 compared to 2006 is related to a prolonged cold spell from day 85 to day 110. This work lays the foundation for regional- to continental-scale camera-based monitoring of phenology at network observatory sites, e.g., National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) or AmeriFlux. © 2009 by the Ecological Society ot America.},

   abstract = {The responses of plants to climate change are typically reflected in the changes in leaf and flowering phenology. By exploiting the strength and simplicity of repeated digital photography and color indices, a majority of the phenological studies have been successful at investigating leaf phenology, while flowering phenology is rarely studied using the automatic capture and analysis of repeated photography. In this study, we trained and tested 5 different pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithms to detect flowering events from images of white colored flowering trees and analyzed the possible factors that can affect the performance of the models. We collected images from the web and processed the images into a binary classification dataset in which a positive label indicated a tree in bloom. We also installed time-lapse cameras and captured images to validate the performances of the models in the real-world. Regarding the CNN architectures, the VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet101, MobileNet, and NASNet models were adopted, and the model weights were pretrained using the ImageNet-1000 dataset. After 20 epochs of training with 16,005 images, all of the models were successfully trained, reaching over 98% test accuracy, and 4 models reached over 99% test accuracy. All the models also showed accurate and stable performances in detecting flowering in time-series datasets with a minor inconstancy at the beginning of the flowering stages. Overall, the NASNet model showed the best performance in both the test dataset and the time-series datasets. A detailed analysis of the performance revealed that the models were especially prone to misclassify images with small relative flowering areas and were affected by the number of samples in the training dataset. We concluded that the preprocessing of the images and the size of the training dataset are essential for the high performance of the models compared to the architecture of the individual models. Furthermore, in addition to the need for a larger dataset, the proper resolution is required to successfully detect flowering from repeated photography, and most current phenological networks do not meet this condition. We suggest that mid-range photography combined with CNN algorithms can be a legitimate approach to properly accumulate and automatically process the data for studying flowering phenology.},

   abstract = {Repeat photography is an efficient method for documenting long-term landscape changes. So far, the usage of repeat photographs for quantitative analyses is limited to approaches based on manual classification. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the automatic detection and classification of woody regrowth vegetation in repeat landscape photographs. We also tested if the classification results based on the automatic approach can be used for quantifying changes in woody vegetation cover between image pairs. The CNN was trained with 50 × 50 pixel tiles of woody vegetation and non-woody vegetation. We then tested the classifier on 17 pairs of repeat photographs to assess the model performance on unseen data. Results show that the CNN performed well in differentiating woody vegetation from non-woody vegetation (accuracy = 87.7%), but accuracy varied strongly between individual images. The very similar appearance of woody vegetation and herbaceous species in photographs made this a much more challenging task compared to the classification of vegetation as a single class (accuracy = 95.2%). In this regard, image quality was identified as one important factor influencing classification accuracy. Although the automatic classification provided good individual results on most of the 34 test photographs, change statistics based on the automatic approach deviated from actual changes. Nevertheless, the automatic approach was capable of identifying clear trends in increasing or decreasing woody vegetation in repeat photographs. Generally, the use of repeat photography in landscape monitoring represents a significant added value to other quantitative data retrieved from remote sensing and field measurements. Moreover, these photographs are able to raise awareness on landscape change among policy makers and public as well as they provide clear feedback on the effects of land management.},

In addition, we provide novel strategies to build robust structured prediction algorithms, such as input noise-injection and multi-scale prediction objective at training. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in comparison to the deterministic deep neural network counterparts in generating diverse but realistic structured output predictions using stochastic inference.

Terrestrial photography offers a high potential to monitor snow cover variability, but its application is often limited to small catchment scales. Here, we present a semiautomatic procedure to derive snow cover maps from publicly available webcam images in the Swiss Alps and propose a procedure for the georectification and snow classification of such images. In order to avoid the effort of manually setting ground control points (GCPs) for each webcam, we implement a novel registration approach that automatically resolves camera parameters (camera orientation; principal point; field of view, FOV) by using an estimate of the webcams' positions and a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM). Furthermore, we propose an automatic image-to-image alignment to correct small changes in camera orientation and compare and analyze two recent snow classification methods. The resulting snow cover maps indicate whether a DEM grid is snow-covered, snow-free, or not visible from webcams' positions. GCPs are used to evaluate our novel automatic image registration approach.

Recently, several studies focused on unsupervised learning methods by autoencoders to learn and extract more efficient features for clustering purposes. This paper proposes a Boosted Convolutional AutoEncoder (BCAE) method based on feature learning for efficient urban image clustering. The proposed method was applied to multi-sensor remote-sensing images through a multistep workflow. The optical data were first preprocessed by applying a Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) transformation. Then, these MNF features, in addition to the normalized Digital Surface Model (nDSM) and vegetation indexes such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Excess Green (ExG(2)), were used as the inputs of the BCAE model. Next, our proposed convolutional autoencoder was trained to automatically encode upgraded features and boost the hand-crafted features for producing more clustering-friendly ones. Then, we employed the Mini Batch K-Means algorithm to cluster deep features. Finally, the comparative feature sets were manually designed in three modes to prove the efficiency of the proposed method in extracting compelling features. Experiments on three datasets show the efficiency of BCAE for feature learning. According to the experimental results, by applying the proposed method, the ultimate features become more suitable for clustering, and spatial correlation among the pixels in the feature learning process is also considered.},

With the help of hidden nodes in deep layers, a high-level abstraction is achieved for data reduction whilst maintaining the key information of the data. As hidden nodes in SAEs have to deal simultaneously with hundreds of features from hypercubes as inputs, this increases the complexity of the process and leads to limited abstraction and performance. As such, segmented SAE (S-SAE) is proposed by confronting the original features into smaller data segments, which are separately processed by different smaller SAEs.

   abstract = {Alpine ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Although long-term and detailed monitoring is required to conserve alpine ecosystems, field surveillance and satellite remote sensing have difficulties in providing wide coverage or frequent observation in mountain areas. In this study, a new method for monitoring alpine ecosystems by digital cameras was developed in order to detect both snow-cover areas and vegetation phenology at the plant community or species level. We used images from cameras that have been installed at mountain lodges in the northern Japanese Alps (at elevations around 2350-3100. m). Red, green, and blue (RGB) digital numbers were derived from each pixel within the images. The snow-cover and snow-free pixels were statistically classified by analysis of variance of gray-level histograms. A flexible threshold was determined for each image to maximize the between-class variance. The temporal variations of the snowmelt rate showed site-specific characteristics and yearly variations. The snowmelt times reflected the local microtopography and differed among the habitats of various functional types of vegetation (i.e., evergreen dwarf pine, deciduous shrubs, evergreen Sasa, tall forbs, and snowbed plants). In addition, the vegetation phenology was quantified by using a vegetation index (green ratio) calculated from RGB digital numbers. An increase in the green ratio indicated the start of the growing period following snowmelt and a decrease indicated leaf senescence. By using pixel-based analysis of the temporal variations of the green ratio, local distributions of the start and end dates and length of the growing period were illustrated at the plant species level for the first time. The distribution of the start of the growing period strongly corresponded to the snowmelt gradient, whereas the end of the growing period was related to the vegetation type. Our results suggest that the length of the growing period mainly corresponded to the snowmelt gradient in relation to the local microtopography. Thus, commercially available digital time-lapse cameras enabled us to clarify the snow-vegetation relationships and the growing period at high temporal and spatial resolutions. This monitoring method should greatly improve our understanding of alpine ecosystems and help to assess the influence of future climate change. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The technique minimizes cloud contamination, reduces directional reflectance and off-nadir viewingeffects,minimizessun-angle and shadow effects,and minimizesaerosol and water-vapour effects. The improvement is highly dependent on the state of the atmosphere, surface-cover type, and the viewingand illumination geometry of the sun, target and sensor. An example from southern Africa showed an increase of 40 per cent from individual image values to the final composite image. Limitations' associated with the technique are discussed, and recommendations are given to improve this approach.},

   abstract = {How can we perform efficient inference and learning in directed probabilistic models, in the presence of continuous latent variables with intractable posterior distributions, and large datasets? We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differ-entiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions is twofold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.},

   abstract = {The Variational Autoencoder (VAE) performs effective nonlinear dimensionality reduction in a variety of problem settings. However, the black-box neural network decoder function typically employed limits the ability of the decoder function to be constrained and interpreted, making the use of VAEs problematic in settings where prior knowledge should be embedded within the decoder. We present DeVAE, a novel VAE-based model with a derivative-based forward mapping, allowing for greater control over decoder behaviour via specification of the decoder function in derivative space. Additionally, we show how DeVAE can be paired with a sparse clustering prior to create BasisDe-VAE and perform interpretable simultaneous di-mensionality reduction and feature-level clustering. We demonstrate the performance and scala-bility of the DeVAE and BasisDeVAE models on synthetic and real-world data and present how the derivative-based approach allows for expressive yet interpretable forward models which respect prior knowledge.},

   abstract = {Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) provide a flexible and scalable framework for non-linear dimensionality reduction. However, in application domains such as genomics where data sets are typically tabular and high-dimensional, a black-box approach to dimen-sionality reduction does not provide sufficient insights. Common data analysis workflows additionally use clustering techniques to identify groups of similar features. This usually leads to a two-stage process, however, it would be desirable to construct a joint modelling framework for simultaneous dimensionality reduction and clustering of features. In this paper, we propose to achieve this through the BasisVAE : a combination of the VAE and a probabilistic clustering prior, which lets us learn a one-hot basis function representation as part of the decoder network. Furthermore, for scenarios where not all features are aligned, we develop an extension to handle translation-invariant basis functions. We show how a collapsed variational inference scheme leads to scalable and efficient inference for BasisVAE, demonstrated on various toy examples as well as on single-cell gene expression data.},

@article{Kudo2006Popecol,
   abstract = {The timing of the snowmelt is a crucial factor in determining the phenological schedule of alpine plants. A long-term monitoring of snowmelt regimes in a Japanese alpine area revealed that the onset of the snowmelt season has been accelerated during the last 17 years in early snowmelt sites but that such a trend has not been detected in late snowmelt sites. This indicates that the global warming effect on the snowmelt pattern may be site-specific. The flowering phenology of fellfield plants in an exposed wind-blown habitat was consistent between an unusually warm year (1998) and a normal year (2001). In contrast, the flowering occurrence of snowbed plants varied greatly between the years depending on the snowmelt time. There was a large number of flowering species in the fellfield community from mid- to late to late June and from mid- to late July. The flowering peak of an early-melt snowbed plant community was in the middle of the flowering season and that of a late-melt snowbed community was in the early flowering season. These habitat-specific phenological patterns were consistent between 1998 and 2001. The effects of the variation in flowering timing on seed-set success were evaluated for an entomophilous snowbed herb, Peucedanum multivittatum, along the snowmelt gradient during a 5-year period. When flowering occurred prior to early August, mean temperature during the flowering season positively influenced the seed set. When flowering occurred later than early August, however, the plants enjoyed high seed-set success irrespective of temperature conditions if frost damage was absent. These observations are probably explained based on the availability of pollinators, which depends not only on ambient temperature but also on seasonal progress. These results suggest that the effects of climate change on biological interaction may vary depending on the specific habitat in the alpine ecosystem in which diverse snowmelt patterns create complicated seasonality for plants within a very localized area. © The Society of Population Ecology and Springer-Verlag 2005.},

   abstract = {Because of the contrastive differences in environment and species composition, climatic amelioration may affect alpine vegetation differently between fellfield and snowbed communities. To test this prediction, the effects of warming on plant growth and vegetation structure were studied in two fellfield and two snowbed communities in northern Japan over 7 years using open-top-chambers (OTCs). OTCs increased the temperature by 1.1-1.8 °C, but the effects on snowmelt time and soil moisture were small. Vegetation height and canopy volume increased substantially at both fellfield sites as a result of the use of OTCs. Deciduous shrubs increased substantially at the lower fellfield and graminoids increased at the upper fellfield. In contrast, the responses of snowbed plants to OTCs were not significant. Because snowbed plants are snow-covered until mid-summer, climatic amelioration during the snow-free period may influence plant growth only slightly if the snow-free period does not change. Species richness and diversity were not changed by OTCs at any of the sites, indicating that the effect of warming alone may not be strong enough to change the species composition and diversity over several years. These results indicate significant variation in the response among alpine communities to warming. © 2010 Regents of the University of Colorado.},

   abstract = {Climate impact studies have indicated ecological fingerprints of recent global warming across a wide range of habitats. Although these studies have shown responses from various local case studies, a coherent large-scale account on temperature-driven changes of biotic communities has been lacking. Here we use 867 vegetation samples above the treeline from 60 summit sites in all major European mountain systems to show that ongoing climate change gradually transforms mountain plant communities. We provide evidence that the more cold-adapted species decline and the more warm-adapted species increase, a process described here as thermophilization. At the scale of individual mountains this general trend may not be apparent, but at the larger, continental scale we observed a significantly higher abundance of thermophilic species in 2008, compared with 2001. Thermophilization of mountain plant communities mirrors the degree of recent warming and is more pronounced in areas where the temperature increase has been higher. In view of the projected climate change the observed transformation suggests a progressive decline of cold mountain habitats and their biota. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.
