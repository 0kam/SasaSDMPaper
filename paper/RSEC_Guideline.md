## Peer Review

This journal operates a single-anonymized peer review policy. Except where otherwise stated, manuscripts are peer reviewed by at least two anonymous reviewers and an Assistant Editor. Papers will only be sent to review if the Editor-in-Chief determines that the paper meets the appropriate quality and relevance requirements. In-house submissions, i.e. papers authored by Editors or Editorial Board members of the title, will be sent to Editors unaffiliated with the author or institution and monitored carefully to ensure there is no peer review bias. Wiley's policy on the confidentiality of the review process is available here.

## Refer and Transfer Program

Wiley believes that no valuable research should go unshared. This journal participates in Wiley's Refer & Transfer program. If your manuscript is not accepted, you may receive a recommendation to transfer your manuscript to another suitable Wiley journal, either through a referral from the journal's editor or through our Transfer Desk Assistant.

## Manuscript Types

Original research article - maximum of 5000 words, excluding acknowledgements, references and figure and table legends.

Review - maximum of 4000 words, excluding acknowledgements, references and figure table legends. Reviews should be topical, succinct contributions that identify current gaps in knowledge; provide novel insights into future interdisciplinary challenges and ultimately guide new research. Reviews may include quantitative meta-analyses, syntheses, as well as modelling approaches.

Policy forum - maximum of 4000 words, excluding acknowledgements, references and figure and table legends. Policy forums should support transfer of information between the research and policy spheres. They should be set within a broad policy context and relevant to constrained decision making; opinions should be identified clearly as such and be grounded in evidence. Policy forum articles are reviewed within the board of Senior and Associate Editors but may occasionally be sent for external review if required. Every effort will be made to achieve a quick decision (i.e., 2–3 weeks) for time-sensitive contributions.

Interdisciplinary perspective - maximum of 4000 words, excluding acknowledgements, references and figure and table legends. Interdisciplinary perspectives provide a platform for scientists and practitioners to present personal and well-argued views on current and future priorities for strong, dynamic interactions among the ecological and remote sensing communities. Perspectives also provide opportunities for authors to raise thought-provoking interdisciplinary issues that advance collective thinking.

Methods and Tools - (up to 4000 words total, including tables/figure captions, statements and references list) are articles that describe new software scripts or packages and can serve as a citable entity for software developers. Tools should provide more of a description than a user manual or vignette (although we strongly encourage the authors to provide a vignette for their code to facilitate the uptake of their methods and allow its intended use) and should provide the design rationale and comparison to existing tools, not just instructions. Tools should also include details of at least one worked example, using publicly accessible data unless there is a clear reason not to. During the review process, code should be available for review on an open repository and there must be clear installation and usage instructions such that a reviewer can assess tool functionality. We strongly encourage authors to describe unit tests or continuous integration workflows used to validate the software. At acceptance, the code should be published in a suitable archive. Uploading a package to a site such as CRAN or GitHub in advance is not considered prior publication and will not hinder your submission to RSEC, but if the package has been uploaded to a public repository, please ensure that links to it are suitably anonymised in your manuscript.

Authors are advised to observe the word limit for the article type and may be requested to reduce the length of manuscripts that exceed the word limit before consideration.

## Artificial Intelligence Generated Content

Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) tools, such as ChatGPT and others based on large language models (LLMs), cannot be considered capable of initiating an original piece of research without direction by human authors. AI tools do not have legal standing or the ability to hold or assign copyright.

In accordance with COPE’s position statement on AI tools AI cannot fulfil the role of, nor be listed as, an author of an article. Authors who use AI tools in the writing of a manuscript, production of images or graphical elements of the paper, or in the collection and analysis of data, must be transparent in disclosing in the Materials and Methods (or similar section) of the paper how the AI tool was used and which tool was used.

Authors are fully responsible for the accuracy of any information provided by the tool and for correctly referencing any supporting work on which that information depends. Tools that are used to improve spelling, grammar, and general editing are not included in the scope of these guidelines. The final decision about whether use of an AIGC tool is appropriate or permissible in the circumstances of a manuscript lies with the journal’s editor or other party responsible for the publication’s editorial policy.

## Translated Abstracts

All submissions must be written in English. However, we encourage authors to provide a second abstract in their first language or the language relevant to the country in which the research was conducted. The second abstract will be published with the online version of the article and will not be included in the PDF. Please note that second abstracts will not be copyedited and will be published as provided by the authors, who take responsibility for the accuracy of the translation. Authors who wish to take advantage of this option should upload their second abstract alongside their submission, selecting the file type “Translated Abstract not for Review".

## General Instructions

## Authors’ Contributions

For all submissions where there is more than one author, the contribution of each author should be given in the Authors’ Contributions Statement, included beneath the Acknowledgements in the manuscript. All authors listed on submissions should meet the following criteria. Equally, individuals meeting these criteria should not be omitted from the list of authors:

    has made a substantial contribution to the conception and design, or acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data, or drafting the article or revising it for intellectual content;
    has approved the final version for submission;
    has agreed to be accountable for the accuracy and integrity of work that they conducted;
    has agreed to resolve queries relating to work that they conducted and contributed to the study.

Acquisition of funding, provision of facilities, or supervising the research group of authors without additional contribution (as listed above) are not sufficient justifications for authorship. Such contributions should be listed in the Acknowledgements section.

## Authors' Contributions Statement

Submissions with more than one author must include an Authors' Contributions Statement explaining the contribution of each author.  We suggest the following format:

AB and CD conceived the ideas and designed methodology; CD and EF collected the data; EF and GH analysed the data; AB and CD led the writing of the manuscript. All authors contributed critically to the drafts and gave final approval for publication.

Authors have the option to add a statement on inclusion to the Authors’ Contributions Statement in their published article but are not obliged to do so. In order to encourage more global representation in ecology and conservation, authors are invited to provide a statement detailing actions that were taken during the study to collaborate with, provide opportunities for intellectual input, and share outcomes with stakeholders within the region where the study was conducted. Example statements are given here, for guidance only:

    Our study was based on a meta-analysis of secondary data rather than primary data. As such, there was no local data collection. However, the geographical distribution of the authors broadly represents the major regions of interest in the study, supporting the inclusion of data from peer-reviewed studies published in local languages from each region.
    Our study brings together authors from a number of different countries, including scientists based in the country where the study was carried out. All authors were engaged with the research and study design to ensure that the diverse sets of perspectives they represent was considered. Where relevant, literature published by scientists from the region was cited and efforts were made to consider relevant work published in the local language.
    Our study brings together authors from a number of different countries but we were not able to include scientists based in the country where the study was carried out. Attempts to identify local researchers whose skills and expertise were relevant to the research were made, but we found a scarcity of scientists working in the region and/or limited capacity for those who do to engage in new collaborations. Where possible, our research was discussed with local stakeholders. We cited relevant, literature published by scientists from the region and efforts were made to consider relevant work published in the local language.
    Our study did not include scientists based in the country where the study was carried out. We recognize the benefits of engaging local scientists with our and aim to embed our future research within the national context and include local expertise where possible.

## Authors’ Declaration

Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation requires a declaration that all authors on the manuscript have seen and approved the submitted version of the manuscript, that all authors have substantially contributed to the work, and that all persons entitled to co-authorship have been included. 

Authors must confirm that the manuscript has been submitted solely to Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation and that it has not been published elsewhere, either in part or whole, nor is it in press or under consideration for publication in another journal.

## Preprints 

Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation will consider for review articles previously available as preprints on non-commercial servers such as ArXiv, bioRxiv,  psyArXiv, SocArXiv, engrXiv, etc. Authors are requested to update any pre-publication versions with a link to the final published article. Authors may also post the final published version of the article immediately after publication.

## Manuscript Preparation

Manuscripts must be submitted in grammatically correct English. Manuscripts that do not meet this standard cannot be reviewed. Authors for whom English is a second language may wish to consult an English-speaking colleague or consider having their manuscript professionally edited before submission to improve the English. A list of independent suppliers of editing services can be found at http://wileyeditingservices.com/en/english-language-editing/. All services are paid for and arranged by the author, and use of one of these services does not guarantee acceptance or preference for publication. Manuscripts should be supplied in a clear, generic and readable layout, and all relevant sections must be included. Text should be double spaced and continuous line numbers should be inserted throughout. The list below can be used as a checklist to ensure that the manuscript has all the information necessary for successful publication.

    Title page, including a concise and informative title, authors’ names, authors’ affiliations, and contact information*
    Running title not exceeding 45 characters
    Word count of the entire paper broken down into summary, main text, acknowledgements, references, tables and figure legends
    Number of tables and figures

    Tables (may be sent as a separate file if necessary)
    Figures
    The manuscript should be double spaced and line numbered throughout

*You will be asked to provide the full address information for the corresponding author. Please be sure to do this, as the processing of your manuscript may be delayed without complete address information for the corresponding author.

## Abstract

(maximum 300 words) should outline the purpose of the paper and the main results and conclusions, using clear and factual statements. Abstracts are expected to set the context and need for the work; indicate the approach and methods used; outline the main results; and identify the wider implications (including, if adequate, the relevance to management or policy).

## Keywords

(4-6) should include the central terms and concepts of your work that enable your target audience to discover your paper.

## Introduction

should introduce the reader to the aims and context for the work described.

## Materials and Methods

should be sufficient to allow the work to be replicated, but should not repeat information described fully elsewhere.

## Results

should be restricted to a factual account of the findings obtained; the text must not duplicate information given in Tables and Figures.

## Discussion

should point out the importance of the results and place them in the context of previous knowledge. This section should highlight the wider implications of the key findings; it can also include clear recommendations for management or policy.

## Data sharing

Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation expects that data supporting the results in the paper will be archived in an appropriate public repository. Whenever possible the scripts and other artefacts used to generate the analyses presented in the paper should also be publicly archived. Exceptions may be granted at the discretion of the editor for sensitive information such as human subject data or the location of endangered species. Authors are expected to provide a data accessibility statement, including a link to the repository they have used, to accompany their paper.

## References

As with the main body of text, the completeness and content of your reference list is more important than the format chosen. A clear and consistent, generic style will assist the accuracy of our production processes and produce the highest quality published work, but it is not necessary to try to replicate the journal’s own style, which is applied during the production process. If you use bibliographic software to generate your reference list, select a standard output style, and check that it produces full and comprehensive reference listings. A guide to the minimum elements required for successful reference linking appears below. The final journal output will use the ‘Harvard’ style of reference citation. If your manuscript has already been prepared using the ‘Vancouver’ system, we are quite happy to receive it in this form. We will perform the conversion from one system to the other during the production process.

## Online resources

References to online research articles should always include a DOI, where available. When referring to other web pages, it is useful to include a date on which the resource was accessed.

## Tables

All tables must be cited in the text in the order that they should appear.

## Figures

All figures must be cited in the text in the order that they should appear. Illustrations are an important medium through which to convey the meaning in your article, and there is no substitute for preparing these to the highest possible standard. Therefore, please create your illustrations carefully with reference to our graphics guidelines (see http://authorservices.wiley.com/bauthor/illustration.asp). It is very difficult to improve an image that has been saved or created in an inappropriate format. We realize that not everyone has access to high-end graphics software, so the following information may help if you are having difficulty in deciding how to get the best out of the tools at your disposal.
