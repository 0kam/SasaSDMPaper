# Discussion

This study demonstrates how snowmelt-driven processes can be quantified and projected at fine spatial scales using ground-based time-lapse imagery integrated with habitat suitability models (HSMs). Using a Japanese alpine system as a model case, we assessed recent changes and potential future expansion of a competitively dominant plant (*Sasa*) at an exceptionally high spatial resolution (1 m). Beyond documenting local vegetation change, our results highlight how snowmelt timing acts as a key biogeographic driver structuring alpine vegetation patterns and dynamics.

## Snowmelt timing as a driver of dominant plant expansion

Comparison of vegetation classification maps from 2012 and 2021 enabled us to spatially identify areas of *Sasa* expansion. Incorporating HSMs further allowed us to investigate the environmental factors driving this expansion. Variable importance analyses for both the TBM and TDM (@fig-variable-importance) indicated that snowmelt DOY was a major determinant. Moreover, predictions for 2030, assuming earlier snowmelt than in 2021, suggested continued *Sasa* expansion. These results indicate that earlier snowmelt has facilitated the expansion of a competitively dominant plant, consistent with previous findings (@Kudo2011EcoEvo) linking earlier snowmelt to increased soil dryness and extended growing periods that favor *Sasa* growth.

At the same time, the TBM substantially overestimated *Sasa* distribution in 2021. Although adding distance as an explanatory variable improved model accuracy, at least two interpretations of the overestimation are possible. First, areas predicted as suitable by the TBM may indeed be habitable, but *Sasa* has not yet colonized them due to its limited dispersal capacity. In fact, no isolated *Sasa* patches formed by seed dispersal were observed in the expansion areas between 2012 and 2021, supporting the idea that low dispersal ability creates a large gap between potential and realized niches. Second, the overestimation may reflect missing explanatory variables. In this case, *Sasa* generally occupies its potential niche, but the TBM overestimated distribution because it failed to incorporate important environmental factors. The improved accuracy of the TDM could then be explained by a strong spatial correlation between the 2012 distribution and such unmeasured variables. Soil structure or soil moisture, for instance, could play this role. To distinguish between these interpretations, the TBM should ideally be extended to include additional environmental predictors, although obtaining such comprehensive datasets remains challenging. Alternatively, process-based models that explicitly simulate dispersal dynamics could help clarify whether the overestimation results from dispersal limitation or omitted environmental factors.

## Methodological implications for conservation biogeography

This study demonstrates that combining time-lapse cameras with HSMs enables exceptionally fine-scale (1 m) prediction of vegetation distribution changes driven by climate-related processes. The integration of time-lapse imagery and HSMs is unprecedented. In contrast, conventional species distribution models typically operate at much coarser resolutions (e.g., 1 km), as future climate projections are generally available only at coarse spatial scales (e.g., alpine vegetation studies: @Amagai2022AVS). By directly observing snowmelt timing—a key determinant of alpine vegetation dynamics—using time-lapse cameras, we achieved high-resolution predictions that would be difficult to obtain using satellite-based or plot-based approaches alone.

Because snowmelt timing requires both frequent and spatially extensive monitoring, time-lapse cameras are particularly well suited for capturing this biogeographic driver. This approach provides a pathway for linking climate-driven processes to spatial vegetation patterns in alpine and other snow-dominated ecosystems where conventional monitoring methods are limited.

## Future projections and scenario-based interpretation

In this study, future snowmelt timing was predicted using a simple linear regression based on a decade of past observations. While this approach provided a useful proof of concept, it does not represent a realistic long-term forecast. In alpine regions, strong seasonal winds and complex topography cause substantial snow redistribution, making accurate snowmelt prediction a persistent challenge. Accordingly, the future *Sasa* expansion presented here should be interpreted not as a literal forecast but as a scenario based on the assumption of continued earlier snowmelt. As high-resolution climate and snow models improve, this framework can readily incorporate more realistic projections, thereby refining predictions of vegetation redistribution.

## Conservation implications

The expansion of competitively dominant species such as *Sasa* poses a serious threat to alpine biodiversity by reducing habitat availability for subordinate and often rare alpine plants. High-resolution predictions of vegetation change, as demonstrated here, provide a practical basis for conservation management by identifying priority areas for intervention, such as targeted *Sasa* removal, and for designing efficient long-term monitoring strategies. More broadly, our results emphasize that snowmelt timing is a critical process shaping alpine vegetation patterns and that fine-scale, process-based monitoring can substantially enhance conservation planning in climate-sensitive mountain ecosystems.
