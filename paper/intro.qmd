# Introduction

Alpine ecosystems are among the most vulnerable to climate change (@IPCCSR2019HM). Numerous studies have documented vegetation shifts in these environments (@Gottfried2012NatClimChange), including changes in timberline positions and alpine vegetation distributions. These shifts vary across regions, driven by complex interactions between geological and biological factors (@Grabherr2010GeoComp, @Klanderud2005JEcol).

A major driver of vegetation change is the presence of competitively dominant species, which can accelerate community shifts by outcompeting other plants. For instance, grass communities in snowbeds (@Grabherr2003book) and shrub communities in alpine grasslands (@Dullinger2003AAA) strongly influence surrounding species. In Japanese alpine ecosystems, dwarf bamboo (*Sasa* spp., hereafter *Sasa*) exemplifies such dominance, expanding vigorously and often excluding rare alpine plants. @Kudo2011EcoEvo demonstrated that earlier snowmelt associated with climate change promotes *Sasa* invasion into snowbed communities, reducing plant species richness by 75%. Conversely, vegetation recovery following *Sasa* removal has been documented (@Kudo2017AlpBot), emphasizing the importance of high-resolution monitoring and predictive modeling of *Sasa* expansion for conservation management.

Because alpine regions are remote and topographically rugged, traditional vegetation surveys are often costly and logistically demanding. Moreover, frequent cloud cover and the complex, mosaic-like structure of alpine vegetation make satellite-based observations particularly challenging. To address these challenges, we previously developed a method for generating high-resolution vegetation classification maps using ground-based time-lapse cameras (@Okamoto2024RSEC). This method utilizes temporal changes in vegetation color captured by time-lapse imagery for classification and applies precise georectification to align ground-based photographs spatially.

In this study, we applied this method to quantify *Sasa* expansion into alpine meadows on the western slope of Mt. Tateyama in the northern Japanese Alps. In the nearby Murodo-daira plateau, *Sasa* species (*Sasa kurilensis*, *Sasa spiculosa*, *Sasa senanensis*, and *Sasa palmata*) expanded by 44–260% between 1977 and 2015 (@Yoshida2016SasaTateyama). However, prior studies relied on field surveys or manual interpretation of aerial photographs, limiting their spatial coverage. By leveraging automated processing of time-lapse imagery, we produced a large-scale, high-resolution distribution map of *Sasa* across the study area.

A key advantage of time-lapse cameras is their capacity to capture frequent, high-resolution records of snowmelt timing—an essential driver of alpine vegetation dynamics. Leveraging this capability, we modeled *Sasa* distributions derived from time-lapse imagery using environmental variables such as snowmelt timing and topographic factors. We then predicted expansion patterns under scenarios of earlier snowmelt. Habitat suitability models (HSMs)—statistical frameworks that relate species occurrence to environmental variables—are widely used to elucidate habitat preferences (@Guisan1998JVS), guide conservation planning (@Larson2004EcolModel, @Xue2021GEC), forecast the spread of invasive species (@Gallien2010DD, @Gallien2012GEB), and assess range shifts or extinction risks under climate change (@Thomas2004Nature, @Bakkenes2002GCB, @Amagai2022AVS).

We constructed HSMs using observed *Sasa* distribution and its changes to address two primary questions: (1) whether snowmelt timing serves as a critical determinant of *Sasa* distribution on Mt. Tateyama, and (2) how *Sasa* distribution may shift under future conditions of earlier snowmelt. High-resolution predictions of *Sasa* expansion can substantially support conservation practices by identifying priority areas for *Sasa* removal and improving long-term monitoring strategies.

This study provides the first demonstration of detecting and predicting vegetation distribution changes using ground-based time-lapse imagery. Our results demonstrate that time-lapse cameras, with their high temporal frequency and spatial resolution, offer a powerful means for understanding and forecasting vegetation dynamics in alpine ecosystems.
