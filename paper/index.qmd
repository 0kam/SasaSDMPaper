# Abstract {.unnumbered}

## Aim {.unnumbered}
Climate change is reorganizing alpine vegetation worldwide. However, the processes linking snow dynamics to fine-scale vegetation redistribution remain poorly quantified. We ask whether spatial variation in snowmelt timing can explain and predict the expansion of competitively dominant plants in alpine landscapes.

## Location {.unnumbered}
Northern Japanese Alps.

## Methods {.unnumbered}
We combined ground-based time-lapse camera observations with habitat suitability models (HSMs) to reconstruct past and project future distributions of dwarf bamboo (*Sasa* spp.) at 1-meter spatial resolution. Time-lapse images collected from 2012 to 2021 were used to generate automated vegetation maps and pixel-level estimates of snowmelt timing. These variables were incorporated as predictors in the models.

## Results {.unnumbered}
Between 2012 and 2021, *Sasa* cover increased by 48%. Over the same period, snowmelt timing advanced by an average of 8.6 days per decade. Variable-importance analyses identified snowmelt day of year (DOY) and distance from the prior *Sasa* distribution as the strongest determinants of current patterns. This indicates that both climatic forcing and dispersal constraints shape distributional change. Scenario-based projections under continued snowmelt advance suggested further expansion of *Sasa* by 2030.

## Main conclusions {.unnumbered}
Our results demonstrate that snowmelt timing is a key biogeographic driver structuring the spatial redistribution of dominant alpine plants. They also show that fine-scale snow–vegetation relationships can be quantified and projected using ground-based observations. By linking climate-driven processes to vegetation patterns at meter resolution, this study advances understanding of how alpine plant distributions respond to changing cryospheric conditions. The approach provides a transferable basis for assessing climate-induced vegetation reorganization in snow-dominated ecosystems, with direct relevance for conservation planning.
