## Changes in Sasa distribution between 2012 and 2021

The area occupied by *Sasa* increased from $8,542~m^2$ in 2012 to $10,170~m^2$ in 2021, a net gain of $1,628~m^2$ over nine years (+19% relative to 2012). The total expansion area—pixels that transitioned from non-*Sasa* to *Sasa*—amounted to $4,095~m^2$ (+48% relative to 2012), while the decrease area (from *Sasa* to non-*Sasa*) was $2,467~m^2$. Many of these apparent decreases likely resulted from shrub encroachment and growth. Under such conditions, *Sasa* can persist beneath shrub canopies but becomes undetectable in time-lapse imagery. Therefore, we adopted the expansion area ($4,095~m^2$) as the primary metric of change. The spatial distribution of expansion is shown in @fig-sasa-expansion. The observed +48% increase over nine years is consistent with previous findings from nearby regions reporting up to +260% expansion over 38 years (@Yoshida2016SasaTateyama).

## HSM performance and variable importance

The TDM consistently achieved higher TSS values than the TBM. Within the TBM, GBT and MaxEnt performed best, while within the TDM, GBT, MaxEnt, and RF outperformed GAM. Ensemble TSS on the test dataset was 0.55 for the TBM and 0.70 for the TDM, indicating clear performance gains from incorporating distance in addition to topographic features.

Permutation-based variable importance (@fig-variable-importance) identified snowmelt DOY as the most influential predictor in the TBM, whereas distance from the 2012 *Sasa* distribution was the strongest predictor in the TDM, followed by snowmelt DOY.

For the 2021 habitat suitability (HS) maps (@fig-hs-maps), the TBM predicted $47,253~m^2$ of suitable habitat (HS > 0.5), substantially overestimating the observed distribution ($10,170~m^2$). In contrast, the TDM predicted $12,766~m^2$, much closer to observations.

In contrast, the TDM predicted $12,766~m^2$, closely matching the observed distribution and demonstrating higher accuracy in reproducing the actual *Sasa* distribution.

## Future prediction and risky areas

From the 2030 HS maps and their differences from 2021 (@fig-future-prediction), TBM predicted $27,049~m^2$ (57% of the 2021 TBM suitable area) of newly suitable habitat by 2030, while TDM predicted $4,387~m^2$ (34%). Conversely, of the areas occupied by *Sasa* in 2021, TBM predicted $2,257~m^2$ (21%) to become unsuitable by 2030, and TDM predicted $717~m^2$ (7%) to become unsuitable.

```{r}

#| message: false
#| fig-cap: |
#|   Predicted habitat suitability of Sasa in 2030 and differences from 2021.  
#|   Habitat suitability (HS) maps for 2030 and differences from the 2021 HS maps. The TBM predicted $27,049~m^2$ (57% of the 2021 suitable area) as newly suitable for Sasa in 2030, while the TDM predicted $4,387~m^2$ (34%) as newly suitable. These projections indicate a potential Sasa distribution expansion similar to the past decade. Additionally, even in areas where Sasa was present in 2021, some regions are expected to become unsuitable by 2030. The TBM identifies $2,257~m^2$ (21%) as unsuitable, while the TDM identifies $717~m^2$ (7%) as unsuitable. These reductions suggest shifts in habitat suitability and Sasa distribution due to earlier snowmelt timing.
