# Introduction

Alpine ecosystems are among the most vulnerable to climate change (@IPCCSR2019HM). Across mountain regions worldwide, climate-driven shifts in vegetation have been documented (@Gottfried2012NatClimChange), including changes in timberline positions and the spatial reorganization of alpine plant communities. Such shifts reflect biogeographic responses to environmental gradients and vary regionally depending on geological context, species interactions, and disturbance regimes (@Grabherr2010GeoComp, @Klanderud2005JEcol).

A key mechanism underlying these biogeographic shifts is the emergence or expansion of competitively dominant species, which can rapidly reorganize community composition by excluding subordinate taxa. For example, grass-dominated snowbed communities (@Grabherr2003book) and shrub encroachment into alpine grasslands (@Dullinger2003AAA) illustrate how dominance hierarchies mediate vegetation change across alpine landscapes. In Japanese alpine ecosystems, dwarf bamboo (*Sasa* spp., hereafter *Sasa*) represents a pronounced example of such dominance. Earlier snowmelt associated with climate change promotes *Sasa* invasion into snowbed communities, resulting in substantial reductions in plant species richness (@Kudo2011EcoEvo). Conversely, vegetation recovery following *Sasa* removal has been documented (@Kudo2017AlpBot), highlighting the importance of understanding how climate-driven processes regulate the spatial dynamics of dominant alpine plants for conservation.

Despite their importance, fine-scale biogeographic processes in alpine ecosystems remain difficult to quantify. Alpine regions are remote and topographically rugged, making traditional vegetation surveys costly and logistically demanding. Satellite-based observations are also limited by frequent cloud cover and the fine-grained, mosaic structure of alpine vegetation. These constraints hinder our ability to link environmental drivers, such as snowmelt timing, to observed vegetation patterns at ecologically meaningful scales.

To address these challenges, a method for generating high-resolution vegetation classification maps using ground-based time-lapse cameras has been developed (@Okamoto2024RSEC). This approach exploits temporal changes in vegetation colour captured by fixed cameras and applies precise georectification to align ground-based imagery spatially. By combining high temporal frequency with fine spatial resolution, time-lapse cameras provide an opportunity to quantify climate-driven biogeographic processes that are difficult to observe using conventional approaches.

Here, we apply this framework to a Japanese alpine system as a model case to examine snowmelt-driven vegetation dynamics. Specifically, we quantified *Sasa* expansion into alpine meadows on the western slope of Mt. Tateyama in the northern Japanese Alps. In the nearby Murodo-daira plateau, *Sasa* species (*Sasa kurilensis*, *Sasa spiculosa*, *Sasa senanensis*, and *Sasa palmata*) expanded by 44–260% between 1977 and 2015 (@Yoshida2016SasaTateyama). Previous studies relied primarily on field surveys or manual interpretation of aerial photographs, limiting spatial resolution and temporal continuity. By contrast, automated processing of time-lapse imagery enabled us to generate large-scale, high-resolution maps of *Sasa* distribution across the study area.

A particular advantage of time-lapse cameras is their capacity to capture frequent, site-specific records of snowmelt timing, a fundamental driver of alpine vegetation dynamics. Leveraging this capability, we modelled *Sasa* distributions derived from time-lapse imagery using environmental variables such as snowmelt timing and topographic factors, and predicted distributional shifts under scenarios of earlier snowmelt. Habitat suitability models (HSMs)—statistical frameworks relating species occurrence to environmental conditions—are widely used to elucidate habitat preferences (@Guisan1998JVS), inform conservation planning (@Larson2004EcolModel, @Xue2021GEC), forecast biological invasions (@Gallien2010DD, @Gallien2012GEB), and assess range shifts and extinction risks under climate change (@Thomas2004Nature, @Bakkenes2002GCB, @Amagai2022AVS).

Using HSMs constructed from observed *Sasa* distributions and their temporal changes, we addressed two primary questions: (1) whether snowmelt timing acts as a critical determinant of dominant plant distributions in alpine landscapes, and (2) how such distributions may shift under future conditions of earlier snowmelt. By linking high-resolution observations with predictive modelling, this study demonstrates how ground-based time-lapse imagery can be used to detect and forecast climate-driven vegetation redistribution, with implications for conservation monitoring and management in alpine ecosystems.
