# Discussion

In this study, we applied the method proposed in our previous work to quantify the expansion of *Sasa* distribution in the northern Japanese Alps using time-lapse camera imagery. By integrating these data into habitat suitability models (HSMs), we successfully assessed the future risk of *Sasa* expansion at an exceptionally high spatial resolution of 1 m.

The upward expansion of competitively dominant species such as *Sasa* poses a serious threat to the conservation of alpine vegetation. The findings of this study provide a critical foundation for prioritizing conservation actions and designing long-term monitoring strategies. In the following section, we discuss the advantages of the proposed workflow for understanding and conserving alpine vegetation, as well as its methodological limitations and future applications.

## Expansion of *Sasa* and its drivers

Comparison of vegetation classification maps from 2012 and 2021 enabled us to spatially identify areas of *Sasa* expansion. Incorporating HSMs further allowed us to investigate the environmental factors driving this expansion. Variable importance analyses for both the TBM and TDM (@fig-variable-importance) indicated that snowmelt DOY was a major determinant. Moreover, predictions for 2030, assuming earlier snowmelt than in 2021, suggested continued *Sasa* expansion. These results indicate that earlier snowmelt has facilitated *Sasa* expansion, consistent with previous findings (@Kudo2011EcoEvo) that link earlier snowmelt to increased soil dryness and extended growing periods that favor *Sasa* growth.

At the same time, the TBM substantially overestimated *Sasa* distribution in 2021. Although adding distance as an explanatory variable improved model accuracy, at least two interpretations of the overestimation are possible. First, areas predicted as suitable by the TBM may indeed be habitable, but *Sasa* has not yet colonized them due to its limited dispersal capacity. In fact, no isolated *Sasa* patches formed by seed dispersal were observed in the expansion areas between 2012 and 2021, supporting the idea that low dispersal ability creates a large gap between potential and realized niches. Second, the overestimation may reflect missing explanatory variables. In this case, *Sasa* generally occupies its potential niche, but the TBM overestimated distribution because it failed to incorporate important environmental factors. The improved accuracy of the TDM could then be explained by a strong spatial correlation between the 2012 distribution and such unmeasured variables. Soil structure or soil moisture, for instance, could play this role. To distinguish between these interpretations, the TBM should ideally be extended to include additional environmental predictors, although obtaining such comprehensive datasets remains challenging. Alternatively, process-based models that simulate dispersal dynamics could help clarify whether the overestimation results from dispersal limitations or omitted environmental factors.

## Future prediction and potential applications

This study demonstrated that combining time-lapse cameras with HSMs enables exceptionally fine-scale (1 m) prediction of future vegetation distributions. The integration of time-lapse imagery and HSMs is unprecedented. In contrast, conventional species distribution models typically operate at much coarser resolutions (e.g., 1 km), as future climate projections are generally available only at coarse spatial scales (e.g., alpine vegetation studies: @Amagai2022AVS). Here, by directly observing snowmelt timing—a key determinant of *Sasa* distribution—using time-lapse cameras, we achieved high-resolution predictions. Because snowmelt timing requires both frequent and spatially extensive monitoring, time-lapse cameras are particularly suited for this purpose.

High-resolution predictions are especially valuable for designing practical conservation strategies, such as identifying priority areas for *Sasa* removal or selecting effective monitoring sites. For example, a prediction at 1 km resolution might suggest that an entire square kilometer is at risk, which would be unrealistic for management. In contrast, predictions at 1 m resolution enable more targeted and efficient conservation planning.

In this study, we predicted future snowmelt timing using a simple linear regression based on a decade of past data. While this approach provided a useful proof of concept, it does not represent a realistic long-term forecast. In the alpine regions, strong seasonal winds and complex topography cause substantial snow redistribution, making snowmelt prediction a continuing challenge. Therefore, we did not attempt to refine future snowmelt predictions here. However, as high-resolution climate projections become available, the accuracy of *Sasa* distribution forecasts will also improve. The future expansion presented here should thus be interpreted not as a literal forecast but as a scenario based on the assumption of continued earlier snowmelt—an assumption that should be re-evaluated as understanding of alpine snow processes advances.
